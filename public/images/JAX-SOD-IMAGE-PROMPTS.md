# Jax Sod - Image Generation Prompts

**Instructions:** Generate each image below using an AI image generator (Gemini, etc). Save each image to a folder organized by category name. Images should look like real photographs — not illustrations or cartoons.

**Tip:** If a prompt produces something that looks too "AI", try adding "realistic photograph, natural lighting, no text or watermarks" to the end.

**Target:** ~8 images per category. Each prompt is numbered for tracking.
