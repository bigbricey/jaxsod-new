# Jacksonville Lawn Care Calendar — Month-by-Month Guide for 2026

After maintaining lawns throughout Northeast Florida for over a decade, I've learned that timing is everything when it comes to lawn care in Jacksonville. Our unique climate—with mild winters, hot humid summers, and distinct wet and dry seasons—requires a strategic approach that many generic lawn care guides simply don't address.

Whether you have St. Augustine grass in Ponte Vedra, Zoysia in Mandarin, or Bermuda grass near NAS Jax, this detailed calendar will help you maintain a beautiful, healthy lawn year-round while working with, not against, Jacksonville's climate patterns.

## Understanding Jacksonville's Climate Zones and Grass Types

### Climate Considerations for 2026

Jacksonville sits in USDA Hardiness Zones 9a and 9b, with average winter lows rarely dropping below 25°F. Our growing season typically runs from March through October, with peak growth during the hot, humid summer months.

**Key Climate Factors**:
- **Rainfall patterns**: Wet season (June-September), dry season (October-May)
- **Temperature extremes**: Summer highs in the 90s, winter lows occasionally in the 20s
- **Humidity**: High year-round, affecting disease pressure and watering needs
- **Storm season**: Hurricane season runs June 1 - November 30

### Grass Types and Their Characteristics

**St. Augustine**: Most popular in Jacksonville, thrives in heat and humidity, moderate shade tolerance
**Zoysia**: Heat and drought tolerant, slower establishment, excellent durability
**Bermuda**: Extremely heat tolerant, full sun requirement, goes dormant in winter

## January 2026: Planning and Preparation

### Weather Expectations
January typically brings our coolest weather, with average highs around 65°F and lows near 45°F. Frost is possible, especially in northern Duval County areas like Fernandina Beach and Callahan.

### St. Augustine Grass Care
- **Mowing**: Maintain dormant grass at 3-4 inches if growth occurs
- **Watering**: Minimal—only if extended dry period (7+ days without rain)
- **Fertilization**: AVOID—grass is dormant and won't utilize nutrients
- **Weed Control**: Apply pre-emergent herbicide for summer annual weeds

### Zoysia Grass Care
- **Status**: Fully dormant and brown
- **Mowing**: Only if winter weeds are present
- **Watering**: None needed unless extreme drought
- **Preparation**: Plan spring renovation projects

### Bermuda Grass Care
- **Status**: Dormant and brown
- **Maintenance**: Remove debris and fallen leaves
- **Planning**: Excellent time for soil testing and planning improvements

### January Action Items
1. **Soil Testing**: Send samples to UF/IFAS Extension for analysis
2. **Equipment Maintenance**: Service mowers, sharpen blades
3. **Planning**: Design any landscape changes or irrigation improvements
4. **Weed Prevention**: Apply pre-emergent in warm microclimates
