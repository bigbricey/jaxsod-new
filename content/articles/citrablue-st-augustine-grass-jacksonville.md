# CitraBlue St. Augustine Grass: Is It Right for Jacksonville?

CitraBlue St. Augustine represents one of the most exciting developments in Florida turfgrass breeding in recent years. Developed by the University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS), this newer variety addresses several limitations of older St. Augustine cultivars while maintaining the lush appearance and soft texture Jacksonville homeowners expect. But does CitraBlue live up to its promises in Northeast Florida's unique growing conditions?

At Jax Sod, we've watched CitraBlue's introduction and adoption with interest over the past several years. As a company that's installed sod throughout Duval, Clay, St. Johns, and Nassau counties for 37 years, we're always evaluating new varieties against proven performers like Floratam and Palmetto. CitraBlue brings genuinely improved characteristics to the table, but it also comes with trade-offs that affect its suitability for different Jacksonville properties.

This comprehensive guide examines CitraBlue's performance in Jacksonville's climate and soils, how it compares to established St. Augustine varieties, its ideal growing conditions, availability and cost considerations, and whether it represents the right choice for your specific lawn needs. We'll provide the practical, experience-based insights you need to make an informed decision about this promising grass variety.

## What Is CitraBlue St. Augustine?

CitraBlue is a St. Augustine grass variety released by UF/IFAS in 2015 after extensive development and testing throughout Florida. The university's turfgrass breeding program specifically targeted improvements in shade tolerance, disease resistance, and overall stress tolerance while maintaining acceptable appearance and growth characteristics.

The variety gets its name from its distinctive dark blue-green color, which sets it apart visually from the medium green of Floratam or even the rich green of Palmetto. This coloration results from specific genetic traits that also contribute to CitraBlue's improved stress tolerance.

UF/IFAS developed CitraBlue through traditional plant breeding methods—selecting and crossing St. Augustine plants with desirable traits over multiple generations. This approach differs from genetic modification and represents the same breeding techniques used for decades in turfgrass development. The result is a naturally occurring variety with commercially valuable characteristics.

CitraBlue has been available through Florida sod farms since its release, though availability and adoption rates vary considerably across the state. In Jacksonville and Northeast Florida, the variety has grown steadily in popularity as homeowners and landscapers recognize its advantages for specific applications, particularly in challenging shade conditions.

## How CitraBlue Differs from Floratam and Palmetto

Understanding CitraBlue requires context—specifically, how it compares to the St. Augustine varieties that currently dominate Jacksonville landscapes. Let's examine the key differences that matter for Northeast Florida homeowners.

### Shade Tolerance

CitraBlue offers excellent shade tolerance, comparable to or slightly better than Palmetto St. Augustine. The variety maintains acceptable density and color with as little as 3-4 hours of direct sunlight daily, making it suitable for the heavily shaded yards common in established Jacksonville neighborhoods like San Marco, Riverside, Avondale, and Mandarin.

In side-by-side comparisons, CitraBlue often outperforms Palmetto in deep shade conditions—areas receiving 2-3 hours of filtered or dappled sunlight. This enhanced shade performance opens up possibilities for turfgrass coverage in locations where even Palmetto struggles.

Floratam, by contrast, requires 4-5 hours of sun minimum and thins dramatically in moderate shade. CitraBlue's shade advantage over Floratam is substantial and represents one of its most valuable characteristics for Jacksonville properties with mature tree canopy.

### Color

CitraBlue displays a distinctive dark blue-green color that reads as richer and more vibrant than either Floratam or Palmetto. This coloration remains consistent through most of the growing season and provides excellent curb appeal. Homeowners who prioritize deep, rich lawn color often prefer CitraBlue's appearance to other St. Augustine varieties.

The darker color isn't just aesthetic—it indicates higher chlorophyll density and relates to CitraBlue's improved stress tolerance. The grass maintains better color during moderate drought stress than lighter-colored varieties.

### Growth Rate and Mowing

One of CitraBlue's most practical advantages is its slower vertical growth rate compared to Floratam and even Palmetto. The variety produces fewer seedheads and requires less frequent mowing during Jacksonville's peak growing season. Homeowners can typically extend mowing intervals by 2-3 days compared to Floratam, reducing annual mowing sessions by 6-10.

This slower growth doesn't mean poor density or coverage. CitraBlue spreads laterally through stolons effectively, filling in bare spots and maintaining good coverage. The variety simply directs less energy toward vertical blade growth, reducing the need for constant height management.

### Texture

CitraBlue features medium-fine texture, intermediate between Floratam's coarser blades and Palmetto's finer texture. The leaf width and overall appearance satisfy most homeowners' aesthetic expectations while maintaining better durability than ultra-fine varieties.

### Drought Tolerance

CitraBlue demonstrates improved drought tolerance compared to standard St. Augustine varieties. The grass maintains better color and density during Jacksonville's occasional spring and fall dry periods. While no St. Augustine variety matches Bahia's drought resistance, CitraBlue handles water stress better than Floratam or Palmetto, potentially reducing irrigation requirements during dry spells.

This improved drought performance stems from deeper root development and more efficient water use at the cellular level. In practical terms, CitraBlue lawns show drought stress symptoms later than other St. Augustine varieties and recover more quickly once irrigation resumes.

### Cold Tolerance

CitraBlue displays good cold tolerance, performing similarly to Palmetto in Jacksonville's mild winters. The variety maintains color better during cool weather than Floratam and recovers quickly from the rare freeze events that occur in inland areas of Clay and Nassau counties.

For most Jacksonville locations, cold tolerance rarely limits St. Augustine performance. However, properties in colder microclimates—low-lying areas, northern Clay County, or inland Nassau County—benefit from CitraBlue's improved cold hardiness.

### Disease Resistance

One of CitraBlue's most significant improvements involves disease resistance, particularly to gray leaf spot, a fungal disease that affects St. Augustine grass during warm, humid conditions. Gray leaf spot causes elongated brown lesions on grass blades and can severely thin turf during extended wet periods.

CitraBlue shows superior resistance to gray leaf spot compared to Floratam, Palmetto, and older St. Augustine varieties. This resistance reduces fungicide requirements and maintains better lawn appearance during Jacksonville's humid summer months.

The variety also demonstrates good resistance to brown patch, though all St. Augustine varieties remain susceptible to this disease under favorable conditions (cool temperatures, extended moisture, excess nitrogen).

### Chinch Bug Resistance

Unlike Floratam, CitraBlue offers no special resistance to chinch bugs. The variety suffers damage from chinch bug infestations similar to Palmetto and requires monitoring and treatment when these pests appear. This represents one of CitraBlue's primary disadvantages relative to Floratam, particularly in neighborhoods with consistent chinch bug pressure throughout Southside, Baymeadows, Arlington, and newer developments in St. Johns County.

## CitraBlue's Dark Blue-Green Color: More Than Aesthetics

The distinctive dark blue-green color that gives CitraBlue its name serves as more than just an attractive visual feature. This coloration indicates higher concentrations of chlorophyll and other pigments that contribute directly to the grass's improved stress tolerance and overall performance.

The darker color allows CitraBlue to photosynthesize more efficiently in low-light conditions, partially explaining its excellent shade tolerance. The grass extracts more energy from limited sunlight compared to lighter-colored varieties, maintaining better density and growth in shaded areas.

Additionally, the pigments responsible for CitraBlue's color provide some protection against UV radiation and oxidative stress during Jacksonville's intense summer sun and heat. This biochemical advantage translates into better color retention and reduced stress symptoms during hot, dry periods.

For Jacksonville homeowners, CitraBlue's color provides excellent curb appeal and visual impact. The rich, dark tone reads as healthy and well-maintained even without the constant inputs some other varieties require to maintain similar appearance. Properties in prestigious neighborhoods like Ponte Vedra, Deerwood, and San Marco benefit from CitraBlue's naturally attractive coloration.

The color remains consistent through most of the growing season but may fade slightly during extended drought or immediately following fertilization events. Proper maintenance—adequate irrigation, appropriate fertilization, and correct mowing height—keeps CitraBlue looking its best year-round.

## Improved Shade Tolerance for Jacksonville's Tree-Heavy Properties

Shade tolerance represents CitraBlue's most valuable characteristic for many Jacksonville properties. Northeast Florida's established neighborhoods feature mature oak, magnolia, pine, and pecan trees that create challenging light conditions for turfgrasses. Finding a grass variety that maintains acceptable density and appearance in these conditions often proves difficult.

CitraBlue performs remarkably well in shade that defeats other St. Augustine varieties. We've installed CitraBlue on properties throughout Mandarin, San Marco, and Riverside where previous Floratam lawns failed completely and even Palmetto struggled. The variety maintains good density with 3-4 hours of direct sun or 4-5 hours of bright, filtered light.

In deeper shade—areas receiving 2-3 hours of sun with dappled light the rest of the day—CitraBlue often provides the only viable turfgrass option. While the grass won't display the same density and vigor as in full sun, it maintains enough coverage to function as lawn rather than forcing homeowners toward mulch, groundcovers, or bare soil under problem trees.

Side yards, north-facing areas, spaces under tree canopy, and locations shaded by structures all benefit from CitraBlue's shade performance. For properties where shade rather than budget drives variety selection, CitraBlue often represents the best available choice.

However, realistic expectations matter. Even CitraBlue has limits. Areas receiving less than 2-3 hours of sun won't support healthy turfgrass regardless of variety. Dense, low tree canopy that blocks most light requires alternative landscaping solutions. CitraBlue extends the range where St. Augustine can succeed but doesn't eliminate sun requirements entirely.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Consider selective tree trimming to improve light penetration before installing any grass variety. Removing lower branches and thinning canopy often provides enough additional light to transform marginal shade into acceptable growing conditions.

## Drought Resistance in Jacksonville's Variable Rainfall Patterns

Jacksonville receives approximately 52 inches of annual rainfall, but that precipitation arrives unevenly throughout the year. Our wet season (June-September) typically provides adequate moisture for all turfgrasses, while spring and fall often bring extended dry periods that stress lawns dependent on irrigation.

CitraBlue's improved drought tolerance provides practical benefits during these dry spells. The variety maintains better color and density under water stress compared to Floratam or Palmetto, showing drought symptoms 3-5 days later when irrigation is withheld. This extra margin reduces irrigation requirements and provides flexibility during St. Johns River Water Management District watering restrictions.

The drought resistance stems from multiple factors. CitraBlue develops a somewhat deeper root system than standard St. Augustine varieties, accessing soil moisture below the surface. The variety also exhibits more efficient water use at the cellular level, requiring less water to maintain metabolic functions.

In practical terms, CitraBlue lawns may require one less irrigation cycle every 7-10 days during dry periods compared to other St. Augustine varieties. Over an entire spring or fall, this translates into meaningful water savings and reduced utility costs.

However, CitraBlue remains St. Augustine grass and still requires significantly more water than drought-tolerant alternatives like Bahia. During extended drought, all St. Augustine varieties need supplemental irrigation to maintain green color and prevent dormancy. CitraBlue simply handles moderate water stress better than its competitors.

For Jacksonville homeowners concerned about water conservation, irrigation costs, or maintaining attractive lawns during dry periods, CitraBlue's drought performance represents a genuine advantage worth considering.

## Disease Resistance: Less Fungicide, Healthier Lawns

Jacksonville's warm, humid climate creates ideal conditions for turfgrass diseases, particularly fungal pathogens that thrive in moisture and moderate temperatures. Gray leaf spot and brown patch represent the two most common diseases affecting St. Augustine grass in Northeast Florida.

CitraBlue's superior resistance to gray leaf spot significantly reduces disease pressure during the warm, humid conditions common from May through September. Gray leaf spot appears as elongated tan or brown lesions on grass blades, eventually causing extensive blade death and thinning turf. Severe infections require fungicide treatments that add cost and chemical inputs to lawn maintenance.

We've observed substantially less gray leaf spot on CitraBlue lawns compared to Floratam or Palmetto under identical conditions. When disease does appear, infections remain mild and often resolve naturally as weather conditions change, eliminating the need for fungicide applications in many cases.

This disease resistance provides multiple benefits. Lawns maintain better appearance through summer without the thinning and browning caused by gray leaf spot. Maintenance costs decrease when fungicide treatments become unnecessary. Environmental chemical exposure reduces. Overall lawn health improves when disease pressure doesn't constantly stress the grass.

CitraBlue also shows good resistance to brown patch, though all St. Augustine varieties remain susceptible under favorable conditions. Proper cultural practices—avoiding excess nitrogen fertilization, irrigating in early morning, improving drainage, and maintaining proper mowing height—prevent most brown patch problems regardless of variety.

For Jacksonville homeowners who prefer minimal chemical inputs or have struggled with recurring disease problems on previous St. Augustine lawns, CitraBlue's disease resistance represents a significant advantage that improves both lawn appearance and maintenance simplicity.

## Slower Vertical Growth: Less Time Mowing

One of CitraBlue's most appreciated practical benefits is reduced vertical growth rate compared to other St. Augustine varieties, particularly Floratam. During Jacksonville's peak growing season (May-September), Floratam may require mowing twice weekly to maintain proper height and prevent scalping when you finally cut it. This aggressive growth creates beautiful, dense turf but demands substantial time investment.

CitraBlue grows more slowly vertically while maintaining excellent lateral spread through stolons. In practical terms, this means mowing every 7-10 days during peak growth rather than every 4-5 days. Homeowners save 6-10 mowing sessions annually compared to Floratam, freeing up summer weekends for activities other than lawn maintenance.

The slower growth also reduces the risk of scalping when life disrupts your mowing schedule. Missing a planned mowing creates less accumulated growth with CitraBlue, making it easier to catch up without damaging the grass by removing too much blade at once.

Despite slower vertical growth, CitraBlue maintains excellent density through vigorous stolon production. The grass fills in bare spots effectively and creates thick turf that resists weed invasion. You're not sacrificing coverage or quality by choosing a slower-growing variety—you're simply redirecting the grass's energy from constant height increase toward beneficial lateral expansion.

For busy Jacksonville families, professionals with demanding careers, or anyone who views mowing as a necessary chore rather than an enjoyable hobby, CitraBlue's reduced mowing requirement represents a valuable quality-of-life improvement that shouldn't be underestimated.

## Availability and Cost in Jacksonville

CitraBlue availability in Northeast Florida has improved significantly since the variety's initial release, but it remains less widely stocked than Floratam or Palmetto. Not all sod farms grow CitraBlue, and some suppliers carry it only seasonally or by special order. This limited availability can affect installation timing and project planning.

At Jax Sod, we can source CitraBlue for Jacksonville-area installations, though lead time may be longer than for Floratam or Palmetto. We recommend contacting us early in your planning process if you're interested in CitraBlue so we can coordinate availability and timing for your project.

### Pricing

CitraBlue typically costs more than Floratam but prices similarly to Palmetto, usually running $0.45-$0.65 per square foot depending on quantity, season, and supplier. The premium over Floratam (which runs $0.35-$0.50 per square foot) amounts to roughly 25-40%, similar to the Palmetto premium.

For a typical 5,000 square foot Jacksonville lawn, CitraBlue might cost $2,250-$3,250 for materials versus $1,750-$2,500 for Floratam—a difference of $500-$750. Whether this premium is justified depends on your specific property conditions and priorities.

The improved shade tolerance, disease resistance, and reduced mowing requirements provide tangible value that may offset the higher upfront cost through reduced long-term maintenance expenses and better performance in challenging conditions. Properties where Floratam would struggle or fail due to shade particularly benefit from investing in CitraBlue's superior shade performance.

## Ideal Growing Conditions for CitraBlue in Northeast Florida

CitraBlue performs best in Jacksonville when provided with these conditions:

### Sun Exposure

CitraBlue thrives in partial shade to full sun, requiring 3-4 hours minimum daily sun exposure. The variety performs best with 5-7 hours of sun but maintains acceptable quality down to 3 hours—a critical difference from Floratam's 4-5 hour minimum.

Full sun locations work excellently for CitraBlue, though you won't gain advantages over Floratam in these conditions beyond slower growth and potential drought tolerance. The variety's true value emerges in partial shade where Floratam fails.

### Soil Conditions

Like all St. Augustine varieties, CitraBlue prefers well-drained soil with pH 6.0-7.0. Jacksonville's typical sandy soils suit CitraBlue well, though the variety benefits from 2-3 inches of quality topsoil or organic matter incorporation during installation to improve water and nutrient retention.

Poorly drained sites with standing water after rain create problems for all St. Augustine varieties, including CitraBlue. Address drainage issues before installation through grading, French drains, or other solutions.

### Maintenance Requirements

CitraBlue requires similar maintenance to other quality St. Augustine varieties:

**Mowing:** Maintain height at 3.5-4.5 inches, removing no more than one-third of blade height per mowing. Expect to mow every 7-10 days during peak season.

**Fertilization:** Apply 4-6 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet annually, split across applications in April, June, August, and optionally September. Use slow-release fertilizers with 3-1-2 or 4-1-2 ratios.

**Irrigation:** Water deeply and infrequently, applying 0.75-1.0 inches weekly through rainfall or irrigation during active growth. CitraBlue's drought tolerance allows slightly extended intervals between watering compared to other varieties.

**Pest Management:** Monitor for chinch bugs, particularly during hot, dry periods from May through September. CitraBlue has no special chinch bug resistance and requires treatment if infestations occur.

### Best Locations for CitraBlue

CitraBlue excels in these Jacksonville situations:

- Properties with mature tree canopy creating partial to moderate shade
- Yards where previous St. Augustine lawns thinned or failed due to shade
- Homeowners prioritizing dark, rich color and premium appearance
- Properties with moderate drought stress where reduced irrigation is valuable
- Locations with history of gray leaf spot or other disease problems
- Busy homeowners who want to reduce mowing frequency
- Neighborhoods where chinch bug pressure is minimal

## Common Questions About CitraBlue in Jacksonville

**How long has CitraBlue been available?** UF/IFAS released CitraBlue in 2015, meaning the variety has nearly 11 years of commercial availability and real-world performance data. It's no longer experimental but isn't as extensively proven as Floratam (released 1973) or Palmetto (released 1990s).

**Will CitraBlue survive Jacksonville's occasional freezes?** Yes. CitraBlue's cold tolerance matches Palmetto and exceeds Floratam. The variety handles Jacksonville's mild winters without problems and recovers quickly from the rare freeze events in inland areas.

**Does CitraBlue require different fertilizers or special care?** No. CitraBlue maintenance mirrors other quality St. Augustine varieties. Use standard slow-release fertilizers, maintain proper mowing height, irrigate appropriately, and monitor for common pests.

**Can I mix CitraBlue with other grass varieties?** Yes, though we typically recommend using a single variety throughout visible areas for uniform appearance. Mixed varieties create distinct visual zones where different colors and textures meet.

**How quickly does CitraBlue establish from sod?** CitraBlue establishes at typical St. Augustine rates, rooting firmly within 2-3 weeks under proper care. Initial establishment requires daily watering for the first two weeks, gradually transitioning to normal irrigation schedules.

## Conclusion

CitraBlue St. Augustine represents a genuinely improved grass variety that addresses real limitations of older St. Augustine cultivars. The combination of excellent shade tolerance, improved disease resistance, attractive dark color, and reduced mowing requirements creates a compelling package for many Jacksonville properties, particularly those with challenging shade conditions or homeowners seeking lower-maintenance lawns.

The variety's development by UF/IFAS demonstrates the ongoing innovation in turfgrass breeding specifically targeted to Florida's growing conditions. CitraBlue was designed for our climate, soils, and pest pressures, making it inherently well-suited to Northeast Florida applications.

However, CitraBlue isn't automatically superior to established varieties for all situations. Properties with full sun and chinch bug pressure may perform better with Floratam's pest resistance and lower cost. Budget-conscious homeowners with large properties may find the premium pricing difficult to justify when Floratam would perform adequately.

At Jax Sod, we've installed CitraBlue throughout Jacksonville, Ponte Vedra, Orange Park, and St. Johns County over recent years. The variety consistently delivers on its promises in appropriate applications—shaded properties see dramatic improvements over previous Floratam lawns, disease pressure decreases noticeably, and homeowners appreciate the reduced mowing requirements and attractive color.

For properties where shade tolerance drives variety selection, CitraBlue has become our default recommendation over Palmetto due to its slightly superior very-low-light performance and improved disease resistance. For full-sun properties, we discuss trade-offs between CitraBlue's benefits and Floratam's chinch bug resistance and lower cost to determine which better fits each homeowner's priorities.
