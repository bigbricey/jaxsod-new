# Westside Jacksonville Lawn Care & Sod Installation

The Westside covers a massive area from the St. Johns River west to the county line, including everything from historic Ortega to rapidly developing areas around Cecil Commerce Center. This diversity means lawn care needs vary more than in other parts of Jacksonville.

Newer developments around Argyle and north of 103rd Street have different challenges than established neighborhoods like Ortega Forest or Murray Hill. The fundamentals remain the same—sandy soil, Zone 9b climate, hot humid summers—but application varies by property age and condition.

## Understanding Westside Soil

Sandy soil dominates the Westside like everywhere else in Jacksonville. The key difference is how it's been managed. New construction often means disturbed soil, builder-grade topsoil spread thin over fill, and compaction from heavy equipment.

Established areas have soil that's been worked for decades. Regular fertilization, organic matter from grass clippings, and the effects of mature landscaping create slightly different conditions than raw sand.

Properties near the river—particularly around Ortega and Venetia—sometimes have heavier soil mixed with the sand base. This improves water retention slightly but doesn't fundamentally change management approaches.

The newest developments west of Chaffee Road and around Cecil Field often have the most challenging soil. Construction grading, lot development, and minimal topsoil create tough establishment conditions for new sod.

## Grass Choices for Westside Properties

St. Augustine grass is the default choice across the Westside, but variety selection matters more than people realize.

Floratam St. Augustine works well in full-sun areas. Most new construction uses Floratam because it establishes reliably, spreads aggressively, and creates dense turf. The drawback is limited shade tolerance and susceptibility to chinch bugs.

Palmetto St. Augustine fits better in established neighborhoods with mature trees. It handles shade better than Floratam and shows improved cold tolerance. The darker green color appeals to many homeowners.

Bahia grass appears in some Westside properties, particularly larger lots maintained for lower cost. It tolerates drought well, needs less fertilizer, and handles our sandy soil without complaint. The coarse texture and open growth habit aren't for everyone, but it's practical for certain situations.

Zoysia has gained popularity in newer developments around Argyle. It needs less water once established, tolerates moderate shade, and creates a fine-textured lawn. The slower growth rate means less frequent mowing.

Bermuda grass works for full-sun areas but goes dormant and brown during winter. Most Westside homeowners prefer year-round green grass.

## New Sod Installation Considerations

The Westside sees more new construction than most Jacksonville areas, which means more sod installation. Getting new sod established properly makes the difference between a great lawn and years of problems.

Soil preparation matters more than the sod itself. New construction often leaves soil compacted and low in organic matter. Even basic preparation—rototilling the top 4-6 inches, adding a light layer of compost, and rough grading—improves establishment success dramatically.

New sod needs consistent moisture for 2-3 weeks. This means daily watering (sometimes twice daily during hot weather) regardless of irrigation restrictions. The watering restriction rules allow supplemental irrigation for establishment.

The first mowing should wait until grass roots establish. Tug gently on a corner of sod—if it resists pulling up, roots are engaging. This typically takes 10-14 days in good conditions. Don't mow before establishment.

First mowing should remove no more than one-third of the blade height. Set the mower high and gradually lower to the target 3.5-4 inch height over several mowings.

First fertilization should wait 4-6 weeks after installation. The sod was fertilized before harvest. Adding more immediately risks burn and wasted product.

## Watering Strategies for Different Westside Areas

Newer developments typically have modern irrigation systems with decent coverage. The challenge is programming controllers appropriately for establishment versus maintenance, and for seasonal variation.

During sod establishment, water daily for 2-3 weeks. After that, transition to the standard twice-weekly schedule. Many people leave systems on the establishment schedule indefinitely, which wastes water and promotes disease.

Established neighborhoods often have older irrigation systems that need maintenance. Broken heads, poor coverage, and outdated controllers create dry spots and overwatered areas. Walk the property while the system runs and look for problems.

Properties without irrigation systems need to water with sprinklers during establishment and dry periods. This is less convenient but works fine if you're consistent.

Watering amount matters more than frequency. Apply 3/4 to 1 inch per session. Any more than that, and water just drains through our sandy soil past the root zone. Shorter, more frequent waterings work better than long, infrequent sessions.

Early morning watering between 4:00 and 8:00 AM reduces disease pressure. Evening watering in our humidity creates perfect conditions for fungal problems.

## Fertilization for Westside Lawns

St. Augustine needs 4-5 pounds of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet annually in our climate. Split this across the growing season rather than dumping it all at once.

First application in mid-April supports spring growth. Use a complete fertilizer with slow-release nitrogen, iron, and micronutrients.

Second feeding in early June prepares grass for summer stress. This is also when chinch bug pressure typically starts building, so some people use a fertilizer-plus-insecticide combination.

Third application in August gives grass strength for fall. This feeding gets skipped often, but lawns that receive it show better overall health.

Optional fourth feeding in late October supports root development heading into winter without pushing excessive top growth.

Newer lawns on disturbed soil might benefit from slightly higher fertilization rates during the first year. This helps grass establish and compete with weeds. After the first year, drop to standard maintenance rates.

Organic matter in our sandy soil is limited. Products that add both nutrients and organic content—like Milorganite or composted manure-based fertilizers—provide extra benefits beyond basic nutrition.

## Pest Management

Chinch bugs are the most damaging pest on Westside lawns. These tiny insects suck sap from grass blades, creating irregular yellow patches that expand rapidly in hot, dry weather.

St. Augustine is particularly vulnerable. Check for chinch bugs by parting grass at the edge of damaged areas and looking for small black bugs with white wings at the soil surface.

Proper watering and fertilization reduce chinch bug problems. Stressed grass attracts them. Healthy, well-maintained grass tolerates feeding better.

Mole crickets tunnel through the soil, creating spongy turf and damaging roots. They're active at night and most noticeable in spring and fall. Heavy populations warrant treatment; occasional crickets don't.

Armyworms can defoliate grass rapidly during late summer and fall outbreaks. Birds feeding actively on the lawn often signal armyworm presence. Look for greenish-gray caterpillars and grass blades chewed down to the stem.

Fire ants are more of a nuisance than a lawn threat, but they're common on the Westside. Individual mound treatment works for light infestations. Heavy populations might need broadcast treatment.

## Disease Pressure and Prevention

Gray leaf spot hits St. Augustine hard during humid summers. This fungal disease creates elongated gray or tan spots on grass blades and can thin out large lawn sections.

The combination of afternoon thunderstorms, high humidity, and warm nights from June through September creates ideal conditions. Prevention is easier than cure—avoid evening watering, moderate nitrogen application during peak summer, and maintain proper mowing height.

Brown patch appears as circular brown areas in spring and fall when nights cool but days stay warm. It's another fungal disease favored by moisture and humidity.

Proper cultural practices prevent most disease problems. Water in early morning, maintain proper mowing height, avoid excess nitrogen, and ensure good air circulation through appropriate plant spacing.

## Mowing Best Practices

St. Augustine should be mowed to 3.5-4 inches. This height shades the soil (reducing weed germination), protects roots from heat stress, and supports deeper root growth.

Never remove more than one-third of the blade height in a single mowing. This rule matters more than people realize. Scalping grass stresses it severely and takes weeks to recover.

Mowing frequency varies by season. Spring and early summer might require twice-weekly mowing. Late summer slows down slightly. Fall, once per week works. Winter, you might go two weeks between mowings.

Sharp blades matter. Dull blades tear grass rather than cutting cleanly, leaving ragged brown edges and creating entry points for disease. Sharpen blades at least once per season.

Grass clippings can stay on the lawn unless they're thick enough to smother grass beneath. The clippings return nutrients and add organic matter to the soil.

Alternate mowing patterns each session. This prevents grass from leaning one direction and reduces soil compaction along wheel paths.

## Dealing With New Construction Challenges

New construction on the Westside often means challenging lawn establishment conditions. Understanding these challenges helps set realistic expectations.

Compacted soil from heavy equipment slows root growth and water penetration. Light rototilling before sod installation helps, but deep compaction persists.

Thin topsoil over fill sand or clay creates establishment problems. Roots hit the different soil layer and struggle to penetrate further.

Poor grading leads to drainage problems or dry spots. Water should flow away from structures and not pond anywhere in the lawn.

Irrigation systems installed by builders vary in quality. Some are designed well with appropriate coverage and zone separation. Others have gaps, overspray, and poor head placement.

These challenges aren't insurmountable. They just require appropriate expectations and management. New lawns need more intensive care for the first year than established grass.

## Seasonal Care on the Westside

Spring brings rapid grass growth starting in March. This is when you resume regular mowing, apply the first fertilizer, and assess any winter damage.

Summer is survival mode. Between heat, humidity, afternoon thunderstorms, and pest pressure, your job is maintaining grass health, not pushing aggressive growth.

Fall—September through November—is the best season for lawn improvement projects. Temperature moderates, rainfall decreases slightly, and grass grows actively without summer stress. This is the prime window for sod installation or renovation.

Winter lawn care means reduced maintenance. Mow less frequently, water only during extended dry periods, and avoid unnecessary traffic when frost is on the grass.

## Irrigation System Design for Westside Properties

Newer construction usually includes irrigation systems, but quality varies. A well-designed system has separate zones for sunny versus shaded areas, appropriate head spacing for complete coverage, and a controller that allows different run times by zone.

Common problems include: heads spaced too far apart (creating dry spots), mixing spray heads and rotors in the same zone (different precipitation rates), and inadequate zones (trying to cover too much area with one valve).

Rain sensors should be standard but often aren't installed or aren't functional. This simple device prevents watering during rain and pays for itself quickly.

Smart controllers that adjust watering based on weather data, evapotranspiration rates, and soil moisture can reduce water use by 30-40% while improving grass health. They cost more initially but save money and create better results.

## When Sod Installation Makes Sense

Sometimes starting fresh makes more sense than trying to fix problem lawns. If more than half your lawn is weeds, bare spots, or the wrong grass type, sod installation might be the better choice.

New sod provides an instant lawn. Within 2-3 weeks, grass establishes and you're back to normal maintenance. Compare that to months or years trying to improve a failing lawn.

The best time for sod installation on the Westside runs from April through early June and again from September through October. You can install sod other times, but establishment requires more intensive management.

Proper installation matters more than the sod itself. Soil preparation, correct grading, and appropriate establishment watering make the difference between success and failure.

## Working With Westside Landscape Realities

The Westside's diversity—from historic neighborhoods to brand new construction—means lawn care approaches vary more than in other parts of Jacksonville.

Established areas benefit from mature trees, settled soil, and existing infrastructure. The challenges are shade management and aging irrigation systems.

New construction offers clean slates but comes with compacted soil, minimal organic matter, and establishment challenges.

Both situations support healthy lawns with appropriate care. The key is matching practices to your specific property conditions rather than following generic advice.

Understanding Jacksonville's climate, our sandy soil characteristics, and how different grass varieties perform in various conditions allows you to make smart decisions about lawn care and sod installation. The Westside has great potential for beautiful lawns—it just requires appropriate knowledge and consistent effort.
