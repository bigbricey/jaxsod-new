# New Homeowner Lawn Care Guide for Jacksonville

Welcome to Jacksonville! You've just closed on your Northeast Florida home, you've moved in, and now you're standing in your yard wondering what to do with all this grass. If you came from northern states, our grass varieties, climate, and lawn care calendar probably seem foreign. If you came from elsewhere in Florida, you'll still find Jacksonville's First Coast microclimate has its own quirks.

At Jax Sod, we've helped new Jacksonville homeowners understand their lawns for over 37 years. Whether you bought in San Marco, Mandarin, Ponte Vedra, or Fleming Island, your lawn is different from what you had up north—different grass species, different pests, different growing seasons, and different regulations.

This guide covers everything new Jacksonville homeowners need to know: identifying your grass type, understanding our Zone 9a/9b climate and growing seasons, navigating St. Johns River Water Management District watering restrictions, month-by-month care basics, fertilization timing, common mistakes newcomers make, pests to watch for, when to call professionals, and dealing with new construction lawn issues. Let's get started.

## First Step: Identify Your Grass Type

Before you do anything else, figure out what grass you have. Jacksonville lawns typically feature one of several warm-season grass species, each with different care requirements.

### St. Augustine: The Jacksonville Default

If you bought in an established Jacksonville neighborhood—Riverside, Avondale, San Marco, Southside, Baymeadows, or the beaches—you probably have St. Augustine grass. It's the most common turf in Northeast Florida.

**How to identify St. Augustine:** Broad, flat blades (wider than most grasses), dark green to blue-green color, blades have a blunt, rounded tip (not pointed), coarse texture compared to northern grasses, forms dense, thick carpet when healthy.

**Common varieties in Jacksonville:** Floratam (most common—planted everywhere for decades), Palmetto (shade-tolerant variety—popular under trees), CitraBlue (newer variety—deep blue-green color), Seville (fine-textured—less common).

St. Augustine spreads via stolons (above-ground runners) and tolerates Jacksonville's shade better than most warm-season grasses. It thrives in our humid, hot summers and stays green most of winter in Zone 9a/9b.

### Bermuda Grass: Full-Sun Option

If your new home has a lawn in full sun—maybe a newer development in Nocatee, Deerwood, or Town Center—you might have Bermuda grass.

**How to identify Bermuda:** Very fine-textured blades (much finer than St. Augustine), light to medium green color, forms extremely dense turf, spreads aggressively via both stolons and rhizomes (underground runners), feels soft and carpet-like underfoot.

**Common varieties:** TifTuf (drought-tolerant—increasingly popular), Celebration (dark green—used on athletic fields), Tifway 419 (traditional choice), Latitude 36 (cold-hardy—can survive farther north).

Bermuda requires full sun and turns brown (dormant) during Jacksonville's mild winter. It greens up in March-April and grows vigorously through summer.

### Zoysia: The Middle Ground

Some Jacksonville lawns, particularly in upscale developments or homes with significant landscaping investment, feature Zoysia grass.

**How to identify Zoysia:** Medium-textured blades (between St. Augustine and Bermuda), medium to dark green color, extremely dense, stiff growth habit (less soft than Bermuda), spreads slowly via stolons and rhizomes.

**Common varieties:** Empire (most common in Jacksonville), Zeon (fine-textured—premium variety), Palisades (coarse-textured—less common).

Zoysia tolerates some shade (though not as much as St. Augustine), handles foot traffic well, and establishes slowly. It also goes dormant in winter, turning tan-brown from December through February.

### Bahia: Budget Grass

If you bought a home in outlying Clay County, Nassau County, or rural areas, you might have Bahia grass. It's a low-maintenance, low-cost option.

**How to identify Bahia:** Very coarse texture with prominent mid-vein on blade, light green color, open growth habit (not dense), tall seed heads throughout summer (very noticeable), spreads via rhizomes.

Bahia is tough, drought-tolerant, and requires minimal maintenance. It's also the least attractive of Jacksonville's common grasses—functional but not beautiful.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Take close-up photos of your grass and text them to a local sod company or lawn care service if you're unsure. Proper identification is critical because St. Augustine, Bermuda, and Zoysia require different care, mowing heights, and fertilization schedules.

## Understanding Jacksonville's Climate and Growing Seasons

Your lawn care calendar just changed. Jacksonville's climate is different from most of the country, and understanding our growing seasons is essential.

### USDA Hardiness Zones

Jacksonville spans two hardiness zones. Downtown, Southside, and the beaches are Zone 9b (average winter low 25-30°F). Inland areas including western Duval County, Clay County, and Nassau County are Zone 9a (average winter low 20-25°F).

This matters for landscaping plant choices but less so for grass—all our common turf varieties tolerate Jacksonville's mild winters.

### Hot, Humid Summers

Jacksonville summers are brutal. Average high temperatures from June through September range 90-93°F, with heat indices often exceeding 100°F thanks to humidity typically 70-90%.

Your grass evolved for this. Warm-season grasses like St. Augustine, Bermuda, and Zoysia thrive in Jacksonville's summer heat. They grow vigorously, tolerate drought (though they'll brown without irrigation), and handle our intense sun.

What doesn't thrive? Cool-season grasses like Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and perennial ryegrass. These northern favorites can't handle Jacksonville summers. Don't seed your lawn with cool-season grasses here—they'll die.

### Mild Winters

Jacksonville winters are mild compared to most of the U.S. Average January lows around 42°F, occasional freezes (20-30°F) but usually brief, and rare hard freezes (below 20°F).

St. Augustine stays green or semi-green most winters, slowing growth but not going fully dormant. Bermuda and Zoysia turn tan-brown (fully dormant) from December through February but green up when soil temperatures rise in spring.

Your biggest winter challenge isn't cold damage—it's resisting the urge to fertilize too early. Wait until grass is actively growing in spring before feeding.

### Jacksonville's Rainy Season

Unlike most of the country, Jacksonville has a pronounced summer rainy season. June through September averages 6-7 inches monthly—half our 52 inches annual rainfall falls in those four months.

Afternoon thunderstorms are routine. These storms produce intense, localized rainfall—2-3 inches in an hour. This affects irrigation (you'll water less in summer than you think), fungal disease pressure (high humidity plus rain creates ideal fungal conditions), and fertilization timing (avoid quick-release nitrogen during rainy season).

September and October can also bring hurricanes or tropical systems. Northeast Florida sees direct hurricane strikes infrequently, but we get tropical storm effects most years—heavy rain, flooding, and wind damage to trees that can leave debris on your lawn.

## Learn Your Watering Schedule: SJRWMD Restrictions

Jacksonville lawn irrigation is regulated. You can't water whenever you want—there are rules, and they're enforced.

### St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD)

SJRWMD governs water use across Northeast Florida. Their regulations aim to conserve water resources while allowing reasonable lawn irrigation.

The standard schedule (which applies to most Jacksonville properties unless your specific community has stricter rules):

**Residential addresses:**
- Odd-numbered addresses: Water on Wednesday and Saturday
- Even-numbered addresses: Water on Thursday and Sunday

**Time restrictions:**
- No watering between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM (the hottest, windiest part of day when evaporation is highest)

**Allowed times:**
- Midnight to 10:00 AM: Allowed
- 4:00 PM to midnight: Allowed

**Duration:**
- No specific limits on duration per zone, but excessive watering that causes runoff violates rules

### Exemptions for New Sod and Landscaping

New sod, seed, or plugs are exempt from watering day restrictions for 30 days after installation. You can water daily (or twice daily if needed) to establish new grass during this 30-day window.

After 30 days, you must follow the standard odd/even schedule.

This exemption applies only to newly installed landscaping. Your three-year-old St. Augustine lawn doesn't qualify—stick to the regular schedule.

### Enforcement and Violations

SJRWMD regulations are local law. Violations can result in warnings for first offense, fines starting at $500 for subsequent offenses, and disconnection of water service for extreme or repeated violations.

Most Jacksonville homeowners aren't cited unless neighbors complain or violations are egregious—daily watering visible from the street, excessive runoff into storm drains, or irrigation during restricted hours creating nuisance.

But don't push it. Automated irrigation systems should be programmed correctly, and if you're hand-watering, follow the schedule.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Smart irrigation controllers can help you comply while maintaining lawn health. These controllers adjust watering based on weather, skip irrigation when it rains, and ensure you're watering only on your designated days. Many Clay County, St. Johns County, and Nassau County utilities offer rebates for smart controller installation.

## Setting Up Your Irrigation System

Most Jacksonville homes have in-ground irrigation systems. Understanding how yours works is essential.

### Identifying Your Controller

Your irrigation controller (timer) is typically mounted in the garage, on an exterior wall, or sometimes in a utility closet. It's a rectangular box with a digital display or mechanical dial showing days, times, and zones.

Spend time learning your controller. Read the manual (often available online if you don't have a physical copy—search the model number), understand how to set watering days and times, learn how to adjust duration per zone, and know how to manually run zones for testing.

### Understanding Zones

Irrigation systems divide your property into zones—separate areas controlled independently. A typical Jacksonville residential system has 4-8 zones.

Why zones matter: different areas need different watering. Front yard full-sun areas might need 30 minutes per zone, while shaded side yards might need only 15 minutes. Grass areas might need more than shrub beds.

Walk your property while manually running each zone. Observe where sprinklers reach, identify any dry spots or areas with inadequate coverage, note areas that get overspray from multiple zones (adjust to prevent overwatering), and check for broken or misaligned sprinkler heads.

### Common Irrigation Problems in Jacksonville Homes

**Misaligned spray heads:** Sprinklers adjusted to spray driveways or sidewalks instead of grass. Adjust them to target turf only.

**Broken heads:** Mower damage, vehicle traffic, or age causes spray heads to break. Replace them—usually $5-$15 per head plus labor if you hire someone.

**Clogged nozzles:** Sandy Jacksonville soil particles clog spray nozzles. Clean or replace nozzles annually.

**Outdated controllers:** Older mechanical dial controllers waste water and don't account for rain. Consider upgrading to smart controllers ($150-$400 installed).

**Wrong schedule programming:** New homeowners inherit previous owner's settings, which may not match current SJRWMD rules or lawn needs. Reprogram correctly.

### How Much to Water Jacksonville Lawns

General guidelines for established lawns in Northeast Florida:

**St. Augustine:** 0.5-0.75 inches of water per week during growing season (March-October). During Jacksonville's rainy season (June-September), you'll supplement natural rainfall—not replace it. Many weeks you won't irrigate at all.

**Bermuda:** 1-1.5 inches per week during active growth (April-September). Bermuda tolerates drought by going dormant—if you're okay with brown winter lawn, you can reduce or eliminate winter irrigation.

**Zoysia:** 0.75-1 inch per week during growing season (April-October).

To measure irrigation output, place tuna cans or rain gauges in each zone, run the system, and measure water depth. Adjust zone run times to deliver the right amount per week across your two allowed watering days.

## Month-by-Month Jacksonville Lawn Care Overview

Here's a high-level overview of what your lawn needs throughout the year. This isn't exhaustive, but it gives new homeowners a calendar framework.

### January-February: Dormant Season

**What's happening:** St. Augustine growth slows dramatically. Bermuda and Zoysia are fully dormant and brown.

**What to do:** Minimal watering (once every 2-3 weeks if no rain), no fertilization, mow St. Augustine only if growing (rare), sharpen mower blades during downtime, plan spring projects.

**What not to do:** Don't fertilize dormant grass. Don't scalp lawns hoping to "wake them up." Don't overseed with ryegrass (it's popular in central and southern Florida but unnecessary in Jacksonville).

### March: Spring Green-Up

**What's happening:** Soil temperatures rise above 65°F. St. Augustine resumes active growth. Bermuda and Zoysia begin greening from roots upward.

**What to do:** Apply first fertilization of the year (more below), increase irrigation frequency as temperatures rise, begin regular mowing when grass reaches appropriate height, watch for early spring weeds.

**What not to do:** Don't fertilize too early—wait until grass is actively growing. Fertilizing dormant grass wastes product and can encourage weeds.

### April-May: Peak Spring Growth

**What's happening:** Everything grows vigorously. This is Jacksonville's best lawn weather—warm days, moderate humidity, adequate rain.

**What to do:** Mow weekly (St. Augustine) or twice weekly (Bermuda), water according to SJRWMD schedule, watch for chinch bugs emerging (St. Augustine pest), consider pre-emergent weed control if weeds are problems.

**What not to do:** Don't scalp grass even though it's growing fast. Maintain proper heights.

### June-September: Hot, Rainy Summer

**What's happening:** Heat stress, high humidity, afternoon thunderstorms, peak fungal disease pressure, active insect pests.

**What to do:** Reduce or eliminate irrigation when rainfall is adequate, watch for dollar spot and brown patch fungus (St. Augustine), monitor for chinch bugs and armyworms, maintain sharp mower blades (dull blades stress grass in heat), raise mowing height slightly in extreme heat.

**What not to do:** Don't fertilize with quick-release nitrogen during heavy rain—it washes away and causes rapid growth that's disease-prone. Don't overwater even in heat—rain provides much of what grass needs.

### October: Fall Fertilization

**What's happening:** Temperatures moderate. Humidity drops. Grass remains active but growth slows.

**What to do:** Apply last fertilization of the year (more below), maintain irrigation as rainfall decreases, continue regular mowing through October, address any lingering pest or disease issues.

**What not to do:** Don't skip fall fertilization—it's critical for winter hardiness and spring green-up.

### November-December: Transition to Dormancy

**What's happening:** Growth slows dramatically. Bermuda and Zoysia go dormant. St. Augustine slows but stays mostly green.

**What to do:** Reduce irrigation frequency, mow less frequently (every 2-3 weeks or as needed), no fertilization, winterize irrigation system if freeze is predicted (rare but possible).

**What not to do:** Don't fertilize in winter. Don't mow lower thinking it will help grass—it won't.

## When and How to Fertilize Jacksonville Lawns

Fertilization timing and products differ from northern states. Get this right and your lawn thrives. Get it wrong and you waste money or damage grass.

### First Application: March

Apply your first fertilizer of the year in March when soil temperatures consistently exceed 65°F and grass shows active growth—new shoots, greening color, height increase.

For St. Augustine, use a 15-0-15 or 16-4-8 fertilizer with slow-release nitrogen. Apply 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 sq ft. For a typical Jacksonville yard (5,000 sq ft), this is about one 40-50 lb bag.

For Bermuda, use a 16-4-8 or similar balanced fertilizer. Bermuda is a heavier feeder than St. Augustine.

### Optional Mid-Season Application: June (Use Caution)

Some Jacksonville homeowners apply mid-season fertilizer in June. This is optional and should be done carefully during our rainy season.

Use slow-release nitrogen only. Avoid quick-release formulations that wash away in afternoon thunderstorms and cause rapid, weak growth.

Many experienced Jacksonville homeowners skip June fertilization entirely, relying only on spring and fall applications. This is perfectly fine and arguably safer for avoiding disease issues.

### Last Application: October

Your most important fertilization happens in October. This late-season feeding helps grass store nutrients for winter, improves cold tolerance (matters for St. Augustine during rare freezes), and ensures vigorous spring green-up.

Use the same formulation as spring—15-0-15 or 16-4-8 with slow-release nitrogen. Apply 1 pound nitrogen per 1,000 sq ft.

Don't fertilize later than October. November and December fertilization pushes tender growth vulnerable to cold damage.

### Choosing Fertilizer Products

Visit Jacksonville-area garden centers (like Ace Hardware, Lowe's, Home Depot, or local garden centers) and look for products labeled for Florida lawns or warm-season grasses.

Good choices include Lesco fertilizers (professional-grade, available at some retailers), Scotts Southern Turf Builder (widely available), Milorganite (organic option—slow-release by nature), and Florida-specific blends from regional manufacturers.

Avoid northern lawn fertilizers (formulated for cool-season grasses), avoid fertilizers with high phosphorus (middle number) unless soil test shows deficiency, and avoid weed-and-feed products unless you have significant weed problems and understand application timing.

### Micronutrients Matter in Jacksonville

Northeast Florida's sandy, slightly acidic soils often lack micronutrients—particularly iron and manganese. These deficiencies cause yellowing grass despite adequate nitrogen.

Choose fertilizers that include iron for deep green color and manganese to prevent yellowing.

Some Jacksonville homeowners apply supplemental iron 2-3 times per growing season to maintain rich color. Liquid iron applied via hose-end sprayer provides quick greening.

## Common Mistakes New Jacksonville Homeowners Make

Let's prevent the problems we see constantly with newcomers to Northeast Florida.

### Mistake 1: Overwatering

New homeowners from northern states think Jacksonville's heat requires daily watering. It doesn't.

Overwatering causes shallow root systems, fungal diseases, and wasted water. St. Augustine established in Jacksonville yards needs watering twice weekly at most during summer—and some weeks rain provides everything required.

Watch for signs you're overwatering: grass stays squishy underfoot, fungal diseases appear (mushrooms, brown spots), grass thins despite adequate fertilization, water runs off into street during irrigation.

### Mistake 2: Scalping the Lawn

Scalping means cutting grass too short, exposing stems and soil. Northern homeowners accustomed to 2-inch Kentucky bluegrass cut Jacksonville grass the same height—a disaster for St. Augustine.

Proper heights for Jacksonville grasses: St. Augustine 3.5-4 inches, Bermuda 1.5-2 inches, Zoysia 2-3 inches.

Set your mower to appropriate height and never remove more than one-third of blade height in a single mowing. Scalped grass stresses, browns, and allows weeds to invade.

### Mistake 3: Using the Wrong Chemicals

Weed killers and pesticides safe for northern cool-season grasses can kill St. Augustine. Never use products containing atrazine or simazine on St. Augustine—these herbicides are formulated for Bermuda or cool-season grasses and will kill your lawn.

Always read product labels. Look for products specifically labeled safe for your grass type. When in doubt, contact a professional lawn care company serving Jacksonville.

### Mistake 4: Fertilizing at the Wrong Time

Northern lawn care calendars fertilize in summer and early fall. Jacksonville is different—we fertilize in spring (March) and fall (October) but avoid heavy fertilization during summer rainy season.

Following northern schedules wastes fertilizer, causes disease problems, and can damage grass during heat stress.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring Irrigation Restrictions

Some new homeowners don't realize Jacksonville has watering regulations until they receive a violation notice. Program your controller correctly from day one.

### Mistake 6: Bagging Grass Clippings

Unless grass is extremely tall or diseased, leave clippings on the lawn. They decompose rapidly in Jacksonville's heat and humidity, returning nutrients to the soil and reducing fertilizer needs.

Bagging wastes time and money. Mulching mowers chop clippings finely and distribute them evenly.

## Pests to Watch for in Jacksonville Lawns

Northeast Florida has pest pressures northern homeowners never encountered.

### Chinch Bugs: St. Augustine's Enemy

Chinch bugs are tiny insects (1/8 inch long) that suck sap from St. Augustine grass, causing irregular yellow-brown patches that expand rapidly in hot weather.

**Peak season:** May through September (hot, dry conditions favor chinch bugs).

**Symptoms:** Yellow-brown patches appear in sunny areas, patches expand outward in circular patterns, grass pulls up easily in damaged areas (roots are dead), and you can see tiny black bugs with white wings if you part the grass near damage edges.

**Treatment:** Insecticides labeled for chinch bug control—bifenthrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, or carbaryl. Two applications 7-10 days apart usually required.

**Prevention:** Adequate watering (stressed grass is vulnerable), proper fertilization (weak grass attracts chinch bugs), and choosing resistant St. Augustine varieties like Floratam.

### Armyworms: Fast-Moving Destruction

Armyworms are caterpillars that appear suddenly in summer, eating grass blades down to stems. They can destroy entire lawns in days if untreated.

**Peak season:** August-September (but can appear anytime summer through fall).

**Symptoms:** Grass appears chewed and ragged, brown patches appear overnight, you see small green or brown caterpillars crawling on grass (especially early morning or evening), birds flock to your lawn (eating the caterpillars).

**Treatment:** Insecticides containing bifenthrin, permethrin, or carbaryl. Treat immediately—armyworms move fast.

**Prevention:** Monitor in late summer, watch for adult moths (small tan or gray moths flying over lawn at dusk), and treat at first sign of caterpillars.

### Fire Ants: Year-Round Nuisance

Fire ants are common throughout Jacksonville. They build mounds in lawns and deliver painful stings.

**Peak season:** Year-round, but most active spring through fall.

**Treatment:** Mound treatments (drench individual mounds with liquid insecticide), broadcast granular treatments (treat entire lawn to eliminate colonies), or bait treatments (ants carry bait back to queen, eliminating colony).

**Prevention:** Regular monitoring, treat new mounds quickly before they establish, and consider perimeter treatments to prevent colonization.

### Mole Crickets: Underground Tunnelers

Mole crickets tunnel through soil, eating grass roots and creating surface ridges.

**Peak season:** Spring and fall (adult activity), summer (nymph feeding).

**Symptoms:** Spongy soil feeling when walking, visible surface tunnels, grass browning in irregular patterns, and increased bird activity (birds eat mole crickets).

**Treatment:** Insecticides containing bifenthrin or imidacloprid. Best applied in early summer when nymphs are small and vulnerable.

## When to Call a Professional

Not everything is DIY-friendly. Know when to hire help.

### Complex Pest or Disease Problems

If you've tried treating pests or disease without success, call a professional lawn care company. They have access to commercial-grade products and diagnostic expertise.

### Large Properties

If your Nocatee, Ponte Vedra, or Mandarin property has 10,000+ sq ft of lawn, professional care often makes financial sense. You'll spend hundreds on products, equipment, and time—professional services cost less than you think and provide better results.

### Time Constraints

If you lack time or interest in lawn care, hire it out. Good lawn care companies serving Jacksonville charge $50-$150 monthly depending on property size, providing fertilization, weed control, and pest management.

### Specialized Services

Certain services require professionals: irrigation system installation or repair, grading and drainage problems, tree services (pruning, removal), and sod installation.

## New Construction Lawn Issues

If you bought new construction in Nocatee, Town Center, or any Jacksonville-area development, you likely face specific challenges.

### Thin or Patchy Sod

Builders install minimal sod to pass inspection. It's often thin, poorly rooted, or inadequate coverage.

Give new sod 6-12 months to establish before judging. If it remains thin or patchy after establishment, consider overseeding (Bermuda) or plugging (St. Augustine) to thicken coverage.

### Compacted Soil

Construction equipment compacts soil severely. Compaction prevents root growth and water infiltration.

Core aeration in spring alleviates compaction. For severe cases, multiple aeration passes or professional deep tilling may be necessary.

### Poor Grading

Some builders do minimal grading, leaving low spots, poor drainage, or inadequate slope away from foundations.

If drainage is poor—standing water after rain, soggy areas—consider hiring grading contractors to fix it. This is expensive but necessary to prevent foundation problems and lawn failure.

### Debris in Soil

Construction debris—wood scraps, drywall pieces, concrete chunks—buried in soil causes dead spots as grass roots encounter obstructions.

You'll discover these as grass fails in small patches. Dig out debris and replace soil and sod in affected areas.

## Resources for Jacksonville Homeowners

Take advantage of free or low-cost resources available to Northeast Florida residents.

### UF/IFAS Extension Offices

University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS) operates extension offices in every Florida county.

**Nassau County:** UF/IFAS Extension Nassau County provides homeowner consultations and educational resources.

These extension offices are tremendous resources—use them. Soil testing is free or costs less than $10. Expert advice is free. Publications cover every lawn and landscape topic imaginable.

### SJRWMD Website

St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) maintains extensive homeowner resources at sjrwmd.com, including watering restriction information, irrigation system optimization guides, and Florida-Friendly Landscaping resources.

They also offer free water conservation site visits for homeowners—an expert assesses your irrigation system and provides recommendations for improved efficiency and compliance.

### Florida-Friendly Landscaping Program

Florida-Friendly Landscaping (FFL) is a statewide program promoting sustainable landscape practices. Principles include right plant right place, water efficiently, fertilize appropriately, and protect water quality.

Many Jacksonville neighborhoods encourage or require FFL principles, particularly in communities near waterways. Learn these principles—they'll save money and protect Northeast Florida's environmental assets.

## Your First Year Strategy

Here's a simple first-year plan for new Jacksonville homeowners:

**Month 1-2 (after move-in):** Identify your grass type, locate and program irrigation controller for SJRWMD compliance, walk property while running irrigation zones (identify coverage gaps and problems), establish mowing routine at proper height, and connect with neighbors or HOA for local recommendations.

**Month 3-6 (spring/early summer):** Apply first fertilization in March, monitor for chinch bugs and weeds, adjust irrigation based on rainfall, and contact UF/IFAS Extension for soil test.

**Month 7-9 (summer):** Watch for armyworms and disease, reduce irrigation during rainy season, maintain mowing schedule, and observe how lawn responds to heat (helps you understand its needs).

**Month 10-12 (fall/winter):** Apply fall fertilization in October, prepare for winter growth slowdown, evaluate year one lessons, and plan improvements for year two.

## Welcome to Jacksonville—Let's Talk Lawns

You're now armed with the basics every new Jacksonville homeowner needs. Your lawn isn't like lawns up north—different grass, different climate, different care. But with proper understanding, Northeast Florida lawns thrive with reasonable effort and cost.

Don't be intimidated. Thousands of Jacksonville homeowners maintain beautiful lawns without professional help. Use available resources—UF/IFAS Extension, SJRWMD, local garden centers, and companies like Jax Sod—and you'll succeed.

Most importantly, give yourself grace during year one. You'll make mistakes—everyone does. Learn from them, adjust, and by year two you'll have a lawn that makes your Riverside, Mandarin, Ponte Vedra, or Fleming Island home shine.
