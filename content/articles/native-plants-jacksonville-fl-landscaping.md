# Native Plants for Jacksonville, FL Landscaping

Native plants offer Jacksonville homeowners significant advantages over non-native ornamentals. These species evolved over thousands of years in Northeast Florida's unique conditions—sandy, acidic soil, hot humid summers, occasional freezes, variable rainfall, and hurricane-force winds. They're pre-adapted to thrive here without the amendments, irrigation, fertilizers, and pest controls that many popular landscape plants demand.

Over our 37 years serving Jacksonville and the First Coast, we've watched native plant landscaping transition from niche interest to mainstream practice. Homeowners increasingly recognize that natives support local wildlife, conserve water, reduce maintenance, and handle our climate extremes better than exotic alternatives. The Florida-Friendly Landscaping program, promoted by UF/IFAS Extension, emphasizes natives and well-adapted non-natives for exactly these reasons.

Whether you're creating a new landscape, replacing struggling plants, or transitioning toward more sustainable practices, Jacksonville's palette of native plants offers options for every site condition and design style. From majestic live oaks to delicate wildflowers, native species provide beauty and function while working with our environment rather than against it.

## Benefits of Native Plants in Jacksonville Landscapes

Native plants deliver multiple benefits beyond simple aesthetics. Understanding these advantages helps homeowners make informed decisions about plant selection and landscape design.

**Adaptation to soil and climate** is the most obvious benefit. Jacksonville natives evolved in sandy, slightly acidic soils (pH 5.5-6.5) with minimal organic matter. They tolerate summer heat exceeding 90 degrees, humidity levels that promote fungal diseases in susceptible plants, and occasional winter freezes down to the mid-20s. They handle hurricane-force winds that topple poorly adapted species. This natural adaptation means natives thrive with minimal intervention once established.

**Reduced water requirements** save money and conserve resources. Native plants developed deep root systems that access moisture unavailable to shallow-rooted exotics. They tolerate the dry spells between Jacksonville's summer thunderstorms without supplemental irrigation. While newly planted natives need regular water during establishment (6-12 months), mature specimens survive on rainfall alone during normal years. We've installed thousands of square feet of native plantings throughout Duval, Clay, and St. Johns Counties that thrive without irrigation systems.

**Wildlife support** creates living landscapes that benefit local ecosystems. Native plants co-evolved with Jacksonville's insects, birds, and other wildlife. They provide food sources (nectar, pollen, seeds, berries) and habitat (nesting sites, shelter) that support diverse species. Oak trees host over 500 species of butterflies and moths. Beautyberry feeds at least 40 bird species. Coontie hosts the rare atala butterfly found nowhere else. Non-native ornamentals typically offer little value to wildlife.

**Reduced chemical needs** benefit both environment and budget. Native plants resist pests and diseases that plague non-natives in Jacksonville's climate. They don't require the constant fertilization that exotics adapted to richer soils demand. This chemical independence reduces water pollution from fertilizer runoff, eliminates pesticide exposure risks, and cuts landscape maintenance costs. The most successful Jacksonville native landscapes we've installed require zero pesticides and minimal or no fertilization.

**Improved property values** result from attractive, thriving landscapes. Well-designed native plantings look beautiful year-round while requiring less maintenance than high-input exotic landscapes. Potential homebuyers increasingly value sustainable landscapes with lower operating costs. Native landscapes in Nocatee, Ponte Vedra, and Fleming Island communities consistently receive positive attention from buyers and appraisers.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Native doesn't mean wild or messy. Design principles—proper spacing, grouping, pruning, and edging—apply equally to native and non-native landscapes. A well-maintained native landscape looks polished and intentional, not like you simply let nature take over.

## Jacksonville-Native Trees for Landscape Use

Native trees provide structure, shade, and long-term value in Jacksonville landscapes. These species tolerate our conditions and reach impressive sizes while supporting ecosystem health.

**Live oak** (Quercus virginiana) is Jacksonville's signature tree and one of the finest shade trees in North America. These evergreen oaks grow slowly but steadily, reaching 40-60 feet tall with massive, spreading canopies 60-80 feet wide at maturity. Live oaks tolerate salt spray, hurricane winds, drought, occasional flooding, and sandy soil with equal ease. They support more wildlife than any other tree species in the Southeast. Plant live oaks 20-25 feet from structures to accommodate their enormous mature size. In neighborhoods like Mandarin, Southside, and San Marco, mature live oaks are landscape centerpieces worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.

**Bald cypress** (Taxodium distichum) thrives in wet or dry conditions—a rare characteristic. These deciduous conifers grow 50-70 feet tall with pyramidal forms and feathery foliage that turns russet-orange before dropping in fall. Bald cypress tolerates standing water (it naturally grows in swamps) but also handles dry, upland sites throughout Jacksonville. The wood is naturally rot-resistant, making these trees virtually maintenance-free once established. Plant bald cypress in low areas where other trees struggle or as specimen trees in lawns.

**Red maple** (Acer rubrum) provides fast growth and fall color. These deciduous trees reach 40-60 feet tall with 30-40 foot spreads. Red maples grow 2-3 feet annually when young—faster than oaks or cypress. The variety 'Florida Flame' offers excellent red fall color even in Jacksonville's mild climate. Red maples tolerate wet soil better than most shade trees, making them ideal for low-lying areas throughout Clay and St. Johns Counties. Plant red maples where fast shade matters and you're willing to accept their 40-60 year lifespan (shorter than oaks that live centuries).

**Dahoon holly** (Ilex cassine) is an evergreen tree reaching 20-30 feet tall—perfect for smaller Jacksonville properties. These native hollies produce red berries in fall that birds devour. Dahoon holly tolerates wet or dry soil and full sun to partial shade. The fine-textured evergreen foliage and upright form make dahoon holly suitable for formal landscapes throughout Nocatee and Fruit Cove developments. Space trees 12-15 feet apart for screen plantings or use as specimen trees.

**Southern magnolia** (Magnolia grandiflora) offers glossy evergreen foliage and fragrant white blooms. These pyramidal trees grow 40-60 feet tall at maturity, though the variety 'Bracken's Brown Beauty' stays more compact (30-40 feet). Magnolias produce large, fragrant flowers in May-June followed by red seed cones in fall. The glossy leaves and impressive flowers make southern magnolia a classic Southern landscape tree. Be aware of continuous leaf drop—magnolias shed old leaves year-round as new growth emerges. Plant magnolias 15-20 feet from structures and plan for regular leaf cleanup.

**Eastern redbud** (Cercis canadensis) provides spring color in understory settings. These small deciduous trees reach 20-30 feet tall and produce clouds of purple-pink flowers in March before leaves emerge. Redbuds tolerate shade better than most flowering trees and work beautifully under oak or pine canopies throughout Jacksonville. They grow quickly, tolerate our sandy soil, and attract early-season pollinators with abundant blooms. The heart-shaped leaves turn yellow in fall before dropping.

## Native Shrubs for Jacksonville Landscapes

Native shrubs form the backbone of landscape beds, providing structure, screening, and seasonal interest while requiring minimal maintenance.

**Beautyberry** (Callicarpa americana) produces stunning purple berries in fall. This deciduous shrub grows 4-6 feet tall and equally wide with arching branches. Clusters of bright purple berries appear in September-October, attracting at least 40 bird species. Beautyberry tolerates sun or shade, wet or dry soil, and requires only annual pruning in late winter to maintain size. Cut plants to 12 inches in February to promote bushy growth. We've planted beautyberry throughout Arlington, Baymeadows, and Orange Park with excellent results.

**Firebush** (Hamelia patens) blooms constantly from spring through fall. This semi-evergreen shrub reaches 5-8 feet tall and produces tubular orange-red flowers that hummingbirds and butterflies love. Firebush tolerates full sun to partial shade and handles drought, heat, and humidity without stress. In Jacksonville's mild winters, firebush often remains evergreen. Occasional freezes kill top growth, but plants resprout vigorously in spring. Cut back to 12 inches in late February if freeze damage occurs.

**Walter's viburnum** (Viburnum obovatum) creates excellent evergreen hedges or specimen shrubs. This versatile native grows 8-12 feet tall (or 3-5 feet for dwarf selections) and produces clusters of small white flowers in spring followed by black berries. Walter's viburnum responds well to pruning and shaping, making it suitable for formal hedges. It tolerates sun or shade and handles periodic flooding in low areas. Space plants 3-4 feet apart for hedges, 5-6 feet apart for natural screens.

**Yaupon holly** (Ilex vomitoria) is one of Northeast Florida's most versatile natives. Standard forms reach 15-20 feet tall, while dwarf varieties stay 3-5 feet. These evergreen hollies produce tiny red berries that birds consume readily. Yaupon tolerates full sun to partial shade, drought, salt spray, and poor soil. Dwarf yaupon has a naturally rounded form requiring minimal pruning. We use yaupon holly throughout Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach where salt tolerance matters.

**Coontie** (Zamia pumila) offers unique, fern-like foliage on virtually indestructible plants. This cycad (not a true fern) grows 2-3 feet tall and wide with stiff, glossy leaves. Coontie tolerates full sun to deep shade, drought, heat, and neglect. It's the host plant for the rare atala butterfly, a stunning black and red species once thought extinct but rebounding in Northeast Florida. Plant coontie throughout your landscape beds and essentially ignore it—it's that tough and maintenance-free.

**Simpson's stopper** (Myrcianthes fragrans) deserves wider use in Jacksonville landscapes. This evergreen shrub grows 6-10 feet tall with glossy leaves and fragrant white flowers. Simpson's stopper tolerates full sun to partial shade and handles drought well once established. It's pest and disease-free in our experience and makes an excellent hedge or specimen shrub. The variety 'Connie' offers more compact growth (4-6 feet) suitable for foundation plantings.

## Native Groundcovers for Jacksonville

Native groundcovers replace grass in areas where turf struggles or maintenance becomes burdensome. These low-growing plants spread to form dense mats that suppress weeds and require minimal care.

**Sunshine mimosa** (Mimosa strigillosa) creates a fine-textured groundcover with powder-puff pink flowers. This low-growing perennial spreads by stolons to form mats 4-6 inches tall. Sunshine mimosa tolerates full sun to partial shade and handles mowing for a lawn-like appearance if desired. It fixes nitrogen like other legumes, improving soil without fertilization. The pink flowers appear spring through fall, providing constant color. Plant plugs 12-18 inches apart for coverage within one growing season.

**Dune sunflower** (Helianthus debilis) provides year-round blooms in coastal areas. This sprawling groundcover grows 12-18 inches tall and produces yellow daisy-like flowers constantly. Dune sunflower tolerates salt spray, drought, and poor sandy soil—ideal for Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach properties. It spreads vigorously and may need occasional trimming to contain, but this maintenance is minimal compared to grass alternatives.

**Beach sunflower** (Helianthus debilis) is similar to dune sunflower but slightly more compact. Both species work well in full-sun, sandy sites throughout Duval County. These native sunflowers attract butterflies and native bees while requiring zero maintenance beyond occasional edge trimming.

**Frogfruit** (Phyla nodiflora) forms dense mats that tolerate foot traffic and mowing. This low-growing perennial reaches 2-4 inches tall and produces tiny white flowers that butterflies adore. Frogfruit tolerates sun or shade and handles wet or dry soil. It spreads by stolons to form lawn-like groundcover that requires no fertilization and minimal irrigation once established. Space plugs 12 inches apart for complete coverage within one season.

**Creeping Charlie** (Phyla nodiflora) is another name for frogfruit in some references. This native groundcover works well in areas where grass struggles—under trees, in low wet spots, or on steep slopes where mowing is difficult. The tiny white flowers appear spring through fall, supporting pollinator populations.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Most native groundcovers establish faster if you plant in spring (March-May) when growing conditions are ideal. Fall planting works too, but spring-planted groundcovers have a full growing season to establish before facing Jacksonville's summer heat.

## Native Wildflowers for Color

Florida native wildflowers provide seasonal color while supporting pollinators and requiring minimal maintenance. These species return year after year, unlike annual flowers that need constant replacement.

**Blanket flower** (Gaillardia pulchella) produces red and yellow daisy-like blooms from spring through fall. This short-lived perennial self-sows readily, maintaining populations without replanting. Blanket flower tolerates heat, drought, and sandy soil—perfect for Jacksonville. It grows 12-18 inches tall in full sun locations and attracts butterflies constantly. We've seen blanket flower thrive in mail box gardens, parking strip plantings, and landscape beds throughout Nocatee and Southside with zero maintenance.

**Coreopsis** (Coreopsis spp.) is Florida's state wildflower and includes several species native to Jacksonville. Lanceleaf coreopsis (C. lanceolata) produces bright yellow flowers on 12-18 inch stems in spring. Golden coreopsis (C. basalis) offers golden-yellow blooms with burgundy centers. All coreopsis species tolerate full sun, drought, and poor soil while blooming prolifically. They're short-lived perennials that self-sow to maintain populations. Plant coreopsis in mass groupings of 10-20 plants for maximum impact.

**Black-eyed Susan** (Rudbeckia hirta) provides classic yellow flowers with dark centers from spring through fall. This biennial or short-lived perennial grows 18-36 inches tall and self-sows readily. Black-eyed Susan tolerates heat, drought, and neglect while blooming continuously. It attracts butterflies, bees, and goldfinches that feed on seeds. Plant in full sun locations and allow to naturalize—these native wildflowers will create self-sustaining populations.

**Purple coneflower** (Echinacea purpurea) is technically native to areas north of Jacksonville but performs beautifully here. These long-lived perennials produce large purple-pink flowers on 2-3 foot stems from late spring through summer. Purple coneflower tolerates heat and drought, attracts butterflies and bees, and provides seeds for goldfinches in fall. The seedheads offer winter interest and food for birds. Plant in full sun to partial shade in well-drained areas.

**Tickseed** (Coreopsis leavenworthii) is an annual wildflower that self-sows prolifically. These native plants produce yellow flowers on wiry stems 12-24 inches tall. Tickseed blooms in spring then sets seed for next year's generation. In mass plantings, tickseed creates impressive yellow drifts reminiscent of wildflower meadows. Plant once and allow to self-sow—you'll have tickseed returning annually with zero effort.

**Blazing star** (Liatris spp.) produces purple flower spikes in summer. These native perennials grow from underground corms and reach 2-4 feet tall depending on species. The distinctive flower spikes attract butterflies and create vertical interest in wildflower gardens. Blazing star tolerates drought and sandy soil but prefers locations that aren't constantly wet. Plant in full sun to partial shade throughout Jacksonville landscapes.

## Native Grasses for Jacksonville Landscapes

Ornamental grasses add texture, movement, and seasonal interest to Jacksonville landscapes. Native grasses offer these benefits while tolerating our climate and requiring minimal maintenance.

**Muhly grass** (Muhlenbergia capillaris) produces stunning pink or white flower plumes in fall. This clumping grass grows 3-4 feet tall and wide with fine-textured foliage. The fall flower display is spectacular—backlit plumes glow pink and create focal points throughout the landscape. Muhly grass tolerates drought, heat, and sandy soil while requiring only annual cutting back in late winter. Plant in full sun locations, spacing plants 3-4 feet apart. We've installed muhly grass throughout Mandarin, Ponte Vedra, and Fleming Island with consistent success.

**Fakahatchee grass** (Tripsacum dactyloides) is a tall, clumping grass reaching 4-6 feet. This Florida native tolerates sun or shade, wet or dry soil, and requires zero fertilization once established. Fakahatchee grass works well as a specimen grass, screen planting, or erosion control on slopes. The arching form and substantial size make it suitable for larger landscape beds where bold texture is desired. Cut back to 6-12 inches in late winter before new growth emerges.

**Sea oats** (Uniola paniculata) is protected in the wild but available from nurseries for coastal landscapes. This iconic grass grows 3-5 feet tall and produces distinctive seed heads that inspired the grass's common name. Sea oats stabilize dunes and tolerate salt spray, drought, and poor sandy soil. It's ideal for properties near Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach. Check local regulations before planting—while nursery-propagated plants are legal to purchase and plant, wild plants are protected and cannot be collected.

**Wiregrass** (Aristida stricta) is a fine-textured grass reaching 2-3 feet tall. This clumping native was historically dominant in longleaf pine ecosystems throughout Northeast Florida. Wiregrass tolerates drought, poor soil, and fire. It's adapted to very dry sites and doesn't tolerate wet conditions or over-irrigation. Plant wiregrass in sandy, well-drained areas in full sun. This is a specialist species for appropriate sites rather than a general-purpose ornamental grass.

**Switchgrass** (Panicum virgatum) is native to moist areas throughout Florida. These clumping grasses grow 3-5 feet tall with airy seed heads in fall. Switchgrass tolerates wet soil better than most ornamental grasses and handles occasional flooding. It works well in rain gardens and low areas where water accumulates. The variety 'Heavy Metal' offers blue foliage and upright form, though straight species is more appropriate for wildlife gardens. Plant in full sun to partial shade in areas with adequate moisture.

## Where to Buy Native Plants in Jacksonville

Finding quality native plants has become easier as demand increases. Several Jacksonville-area sources offer good selections of Florida natives suitable for landscape use.

**Local independent nurseries** often carry better native plant selections than big-box stores. These businesses typically employ knowledgeable staff who can provide guidance on plant selection and site matching. Ask specifically for Florida natives—staff can direct you to appropriate sections. In our experience serving Northeast Florida, independent nurseries offer healthier plants and better long-term survival rates than mass-market outlets.

**Native plant sales** hosted by environmental organizations occur several times yearly in Jacksonville. The UF/IFAS Extension Duval County Master Gardener program typically hosts a spring sale featuring vetted native species. The Florida Native Plant Society's Jacksonville Chapter also hosts sales. These events offer excellent opportunities to purchase quality natives at reasonable prices while supporting local conservation efforts. Sales typically occur in spring (March-April) and fall (October-November).

**Online native plant nurseries** ship throughout Florida. **Florida Native Plant Nursery** in St. Johns County offers extensive selections and local delivery. **Pine Lily Farms** near Yulee specializes in Florida natives and ships regionally. While buying online requires more research to ensure appropriate species selection, it opens access to uncommon natives not available locally. Order in spring or fall to avoid summer heat stress during shipping and establishment.

**Native plant rescues** occasionally offer opportunities to obtain plants free from development sites. Various conservation organizations coordinate rescues before land clearing for development. These events require physical work—you dig and transport plants yourself—but provide free natives while saving plants from destruction. Check with St. Johns Riverkeeper and Jacksonville Arboretum & Botanical Gardens for rescue opportunities.

**Propagate your own natives** from seeds or cuttings. Many Jacksonville natives grow readily from seed collected in fall. Beautyberry, coontie, and most wildflowers produce seed freely. Firebush and Walter's viburnum root easily from softwood cuttings taken in summer. This approach requires patience—plants take 1-2 years to reach landscape size—but costs almost nothing and ensures locally adapted genetics.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** When purchasing natives from nurseries, look for species names (Gaillardia pulchella, Muhlenbergia capillaris, etc.) rather than just common names. Cultivars with names like 'Compacta' or 'Dwarf' are often bred for specific traits and may perform differently than straight species. For maximum ecological benefit and minimal maintenance, choose straight species when available.

## Designing with Native Plants

Native plants work in any landscape style from formal to naturalistic. Design principles remain constant regardless of whether you're using natives or exotics—proper spacing, grouping, scale, and proportion create successful landscapes.

**Group plants in odd-numbered clusters** (3, 5, 7) rather than single specimens. This creates visual impact and mimics natural plant communities. A single muhly grass looks nice; five muhly grasses planted 3 feet apart create a stunning fall display. Grouping also provides wildlife benefits—multiple plants support larger populations of insects and birds than isolated individuals.

**Layer plantings for depth and year-round interest.** Place tall background plants (trees, large shrubs) at the rear of beds, mid-height plants in the center, and low groundcovers along the front. This creates visual depth and ensures all plants receive adequate light. Layered plantings also provide varied habitat structures for wildlife—some species prefer tree canopies while others use shrub layers or groundcovers.

**Consider bloom times for continuous color.** Redbud blooms in March, coreopsis in April-May, blanket flower May-October, muhly grass September-November. By combining species with staggered bloom periods, you create year-round interest rather than a single burst followed by months of green. Include evergreen structure plants (live oak, dahoon holly, coontie) to maintain presence during gaps in flowering.

**Create informal masses rather than rigid rows.** Native plants shine in naturalistic designs that mimic plant communities. Rather than spacing beautyberry precisely 6 feet apart in a straight line, cluster 5-7 plants in an irregular grouping with 4-6 foot spacing. This approach looks more natural while requiring no additional plants or effort.

**Combine natives with well-adapted non-natives** for the best of both worlds. Purist native landscapes offer maximum ecological benefits, but many homeowners want broader plant palettes. Combining Jacksonville natives with Florida-friendly non-natives (like asiatic jasmine, liriope, and crape myrtle) creates attractive, diverse landscapes that still provide wildlife benefits and require modest maintenance.

## Florida-Friendly Landscaping Certification

The Florida-Friendly Landscaping (FFL) program promotes sustainable landscape practices including native plant use. This statewide initiative, administered by UF/IFAS Extension, provides guidelines and certification for landscapes that conserve water, protect water quality, and support wildlife.

**Nine FFL principles** guide sustainable landscape design:
1. Right plant, right place
2. Water efficiently
3. Fertilize appropriately
4. Mulch
5. Attract wildlife
6. Manage yard pests responsibly
7. Recycle yard waste
8. Reduce stormwater runoff
9. Protect the waterfront

Native plants help achieve multiple FFL principles. They're pre-adapted to Jacksonville sites (principle 1), require less water once established (principle 2), need minimal fertilization (principle 3), and inherently attract wildlife (principle 5). Using natives automatically moves your landscape toward Florida-Friendly certification.

**Certification benefits** include recognition as an environmental steward, reduced landscape maintenance costs, and potential insurance discounts. Some HOAs recognize FFL certification in architectural review processes. The certification process involves documenting your landscape practices and plant selections, then receiving evaluation from trained verifiers. UF/IFAS Extension Duval County provides information and certification assistance for Jacksonville homeowners.

**Educational resources** through the FFL program include workshops, publications, and online materials. Topics range from basic native plant selection to advanced landscape design and maintenance techniques. These resources help Jacksonville homeowners transition toward more sustainable landscapes incrementally rather than requiring complete renovations.

## Transitioning to Native Plants

Converting existing landscapes to include more natives can happen gradually. Few homeowners replace entire landscapes overnight—most incorporate natives incrementally as plants need replacement or as budget allows.

**Start with easy replacements.** When an exotic shrub dies or becomes too high-maintenance, replace it with a native alternative. That struggling azalea could become beautyberry. The disease-prone rose could become firebush. These one-for-one replacements gradually increase native content without requiring landscape-wide renovations.

**Add natives to existing beds** rather than starting from scratch. Tuck coontie, blanket flower, or muhly grass into open spaces in landscape beds. These additions increase ecological value immediately while requiring minimal disruption to established landscapes. Over time, successful natives can expand while less successful exotics are phased out.

**Convert lawn areas to native plantings** incrementally. Remove 100-200 square feet of grass annually, creating new landscape beds planted with natives. This gradual approach manages budget and labor while allowing you to assess results before committing to larger changes. After 3-5 years, you'll have significantly reduced lawn area and increased native plantings without overwhelming single-season efforts.

**Plant natives in containers** to trial species before committing to in-ground installation. This allows you to observe growth habits, mature sizes, and visual appeal without permanent installation. Successful container trials can move to landscape beds; less successful choices can be relocated or replaced without major landscape disruption.

**Document your progress** with photos taken quarterly or annually. Looking back at where you started provides motivation to continue. Share your success with neighbors—many Jacksonville communities have one pioneering native landscaper whose success inspires others to follow. Your landscape can demonstrate that natives work beautifully in conventional residential settings.

## Conclusion

Native plants offer Jacksonville homeowners beautiful, functional landscapes that work with our environment rather than requiring constant intervention. From majestic live oaks providing structure and shade to delicate blanket flowers offering seasonal color, Northeast Florida's native plant palette includes options for every site and design style.

The benefits extend beyond individual properties to encompass broader environmental and community goals. Native landscapes conserve water, reduce chemical use, support wildlife populations, and create resilient green spaces that handle our climate extremes. They save money through reduced maintenance while providing beauty and function equal or superior to exotic alternatives.

Starting with natives doesn't require complete landscape renovations or specialized knowledge. Begin with reliable species like coontie, beautyberry, muhly grass, and blanket flower. These Jacksonville natives thrive in diverse conditions and tolerate the inevitable mistakes that accompany learning new plant materials. As your confidence and knowledge grow, expand into more specialized natives suited to specific sites and purposes throughout your property.

Whether you incorporate a few native plants into existing landscapes or commit to fully native designs, Jacksonville's flora offers tremendous potential. These are the plants that evolved here, that sustained generations before exotic ornamentals existed, and that will continue thriving long after high-maintenance exotics have failed. By choosing natives, you're investing in landscapes that work with Jacksonville's conditions rather than constantly fighting them.
