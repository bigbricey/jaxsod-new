# Well Water vs City Water: Impact on Jacksonville Lawns

When you turn on your irrigation system in Jacksonville, where does that water come from? The answer matters more than most homeowners realize. Whether you're watering your Mandarin St. Augustine with well water pumped from the Floridan Aquifer or your Jacksonville Beach Bermuda with treated city water from JEA, your water source affects everything from your monthly costs to those orange stains on your driveway.

At Jax Sod, we've installed lawns across Northeast Florida for over 37 years, and we've seen every combination of water source, soil type, and irrigation setup imaginable. The well water vs city water Jacksonville lawn question comes up constantly, especially from homeowners moving from urban neighborhoods to outlying areas with different water infrastructure.

This guide breaks down the characteristics of well water and city water in Northeast Florida, how each affects your lawn and landscape, the cost implications, and practical considerations for choosing between them when you have options. Let's dive into what you need to know about irrigation water sources.

## Jacksonville's Water Infrastructure: Well vs City

Understanding which water source you have—or might have—starts with understanding Jacksonville's water infrastructure geography.

### Where Jacksonville Homeowners Use Well Water

Well water is common in outlying areas of the Jacksonville metro. If you live in Mandarin (especially the southern sections), Orange Park, Fleming Island, Middleburg, St. Johns County, Clay County, or Nassau County, there's a good chance your home uses well water.

New developments in Nocatee, Fruit Cove, and other growing St. Johns County areas often include community water systems rather than individual wells, but many established homes still rely on private wells.

Rural properties, homes on larger lots, and older developments built before city water infrastructure expanded into those areas typically have wells. The farther from Jacksonville's urban core, the more likely you'll find well water.

### Where Jacksonville Homeowners Use City Water

Jacksonville's municipal water utility, JEA, serves most of Duval County including downtown Jacksonville, San Marco, Riverside, Avondale, Southside, Baymeadows, Arlington, and the beaches (Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach).

Some areas of Clay County and St. Johns County have municipal water from systems other than JEA. Check your water bill—if it says JEA, you're on city water. If it's from a well company or you have water treatment equipment in your garage, you're on well water.

### Homes with Both Options

Some Jacksonville homeowners have city water for household use but well water for irrigation. This setup makes financial sense in areas where city water is available but expensive for outdoor use—you avoid sewer charges on water that doesn't go down the drain, and you can water more freely without watching your JEA bill skyrocket.

Installing a separate well for irrigation requires upfront investment ($3,000-$8,000 for well drilling and pump installation) but can pay for itself over years of reduced water bills, especially for larger properties in Deerwood, Town Center, or Ponte Vedra.

## Well Water Characteristics in Northeast Florida

Jacksonville-area well water comes primarily from the Floridan Aquifer, a massive limestone formation underlying all of Northeast Florida. This aquifer provides abundant water, but that water has distinctive characteristics.

### High Iron Content

The defining characteristic of Northeast Florida well water is iron. Lots of iron. When you pump groundwater up from limestone, you bring dissolved iron with it.

This iron is invisible in the pipe—the water looks crystal clear coming out of the tap. But when iron-rich water hits oxygen (in the air or in irrigation spray), it oxidizes instantly. That's why well water sprayed on driveways, sidewalks, and house siding leaves orange stains.

Those rust-colored streaks on your Mandarin driveway? That's not rust from metal—it's oxidized iron from well water. It's the same process that creates orange staining on your irrigation heads, orange buildup in your toilets and sinks, and orange-tinted puddles after irrigation cycles.

Iron levels in Jacksonville-area wells typically range from 0.3 to 5.0 parts per million (ppm). Anything above 0.3 ppm causes visible staining. Many wells in Clay County and St. Johns County test at 1.0-3.0 ppm—enough to cause significant cosmetic staining.

### Hard Water Mineral Content

Northeast Florida well water is hard—meaning it contains high levels of dissolved calcium and magnesium. The limestone aquifer is rich in these minerals, and groundwater flowing through it picks them up.

Hard water isn't harmful to grass, but it causes scale buildup on irrigation system components. Spray nozzles clog more frequently, valve screens accumulate mineral deposits, and you'll see white crusty buildup around sprinkler heads.

Hard water also reduces soap effectiveness (you'll notice this in the shower—soap doesn't lather as well with well water), but that's a household issue, not a lawn issue.

### Sulfur Smell

Some Jacksonville-area wells have sulfur content, creating that distinctive "rotten egg" smell. This is more common in deeper wells and in certain geological areas of Clay and Nassau counties.

Sulfur isn't harmful to grass—in fact, sulfur is a plant nutrient. But the smell is unpleasant, and homeowners sometimes worry that smelly water will damage their lawn. It won't. Your grass doesn't mind the smell.

### Variable pH

Well water pH varies depending on aquifer depth, local geology, and seasonal factors. Northeast Florida well water typically ranges from 6.5 to 8.0 pH—generally fine for irrigation, though the higher end can cause minor nutrient availability issues in highly alkaline conditions.

Some wells pull water with pH outside this range. If your grass shows persistent yellowing despite fertilization, and you're on well water, test the water pH. Extremely alkaline water (pH above 8.0) can cause micronutrient deficiencies, particularly iron and manganese—ironic, since the water contains plenty of iron, but high pH makes it unavailable to plants.

## City Water (JEA) Characteristics in Jacksonville

Jacksonville's city water comes from JEA, which treats water from the St. Johns River and the Floridan Aquifer before distributing it through municipal lines.

### Chlorinated and Treated

JEA water is chlorinated for disinfection. Chlorine levels are safe for human consumption and don't harm grass—the chlorine dissipates quickly after spraying, and grass doesn't absorb enough to cause problems.

Some homeowners worry that chlorinated city water will damage their lawn. It won't. Chlorine concentrations in municipal water are far too low to affect grass health. Public parks, golf courses, and athletic fields throughout Jacksonville are irrigated with city water without issues.

### Consistent pH

Treated city water has consistent pH, typically maintained around 7.0-7.5 (neutral to slightly alkaline). This consistency means you don't have to worry about seasonal pH swings affecting nutrient availability.

### Fluoridated

JEA adds fluoride to drinking water for dental health. Fluoride levels are extremely low and have zero impact on lawns. This is completely irrelevant for irrigation purposes but worth mentioning since some homeowners ask about it.

### Metered and Billed

City water is metered—every gallon you use shows up on your JEA bill. And here's the kicker: JEA bills for water and sewer based on water consumption. That means when you irrigate your lawn with city water, you're paying sewer charges on water that never goes down the drain.

For households without separate irrigation meters (more on that later), this effectively doubles the cost of irrigation water during summer months when lawn watering is heaviest.

### Low Iron Content

Unlike well water, JEA city water has minimal iron content. Treatment processes remove most iron, so city water irrigation doesn't cause the orange staining associated with well water.

If you have city water and still see orange staining, you might have corroded iron pipes in your home's plumbing system, or your irrigation system might be drawing from a well that someone forgot to tell you about. Check your water source.

## How Well Water Affects Your Jacksonville Lawn

Now let's talk about what matters for your grass. How does well water actually affect lawn health?

### Generally Fine for Grass Health

Here's the surprising truth: well water is perfectly fine for grass. Despite the iron staining, sulfur smell, and hard water minerals, Northeast Florida well water grows great lawns.

St. Augustine, Bermuda, Zoysia, and Bahia grasses all thrive with well water irrigation. We've installed thousands of pallets of sod across Fleming Island, Middleburg, and Orange Park on properties with well water, and the grass establishes beautifully.

The high mineral content doesn't hurt grass—in many ways, it helps. Iron in particular benefits grass color.

### Iron Can Actually Help Color

Remember that iron in well water? It's not all bad. Iron is a micronutrient that grass needs for chlorophyll production. The deep green color homeowners want from their lawn comes partly from iron.

When you irrigate with iron-rich well water, you're essentially providing a low-dose iron supplement to your grass with every watering cycle. This is why some Jacksonville lawns on well water have naturally deeper green color than similar lawns on city water.

Professional lawn care companies often apply iron supplements to improve grass color—chelated iron or iron sulfate. Well water provides this naturally.

That said, iron in irrigation water doesn't replace fertilization. Your grass still needs nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. But the incidental iron from well water is a bonus for color.

### Staining on Hardscapes

While iron is good for grass, it's bad for everything else. Orange iron staining on driveways, sidewalks, pavers, and house siding is the primary cosmetic downside of well water irrigation.

This staining builds up over time. The longer you irrigate with iron-rich well water, the more pronounced the orange streaks become. It's particularly visible on concrete, brick, and vinyl siding.

Pressure washing removes iron staining temporarily, but it returns after a few weeks of irrigation. Some homeowners pressure wash monthly during irrigation season just to keep staining under control.

Iron staining doesn't damage materials—it's purely cosmetic. But it affects curb appeal, and that matters to many Jacksonville homeowners, especially in upscale neighborhoods like Ponte Vedra or Nocatee.

### Irrigation System Maintenance

Well water requires more irrigation system maintenance than city water. Hard water minerals and iron cause buildup in spray nozzles, clog filters, and deposit scale on valve screens.

Plan to clean or replace irrigation nozzles more frequently with well water. Twice-yearly system maintenance becomes necessary rather than optional. This adds $100-$200 annually to irrigation upkeep costs, but it's not a deal-breaker—just something to budget for.

## How City Water Affects Your Jacksonville Lawn

City water from JEA affects your lawn differently—primarily through cost rather than grass health.

### No Staining Issues

The big advantage of city water irrigation: no iron staining. Your Riverside driveway stays clean, your Avondale sidewalks don't develop orange streaks, and your irrigation heads don't accumulate rust-colored buildup.

For neighborhoods with strict homeowner association appearance standards or for homeowners who care deeply about curb appeal, this is a significant benefit.

### Lower Irrigation System Maintenance

City water is softer and has lower mineral content than well water, resulting in less buildup in irrigation components. Nozzles stay cleaner longer, filters don't clog as quickly, and you'll replace spray heads less frequently.

This doesn't eliminate maintenance—Jacksonville's sandy soil particles still get into irrigation systems—but it reduces frequency and cost compared to well water systems.

### Cost: The Big Difference

Here's where city water irrigation gets expensive. JEA charges for water consumption and then adds sewer charges based on that same consumption. When you water your lawn, you're paying twice—once for the water itself, and again for sewer service you didn't use.

During summer months when irrigation demand is highest, Jacksonville homeowners commonly use 15,000-25,000 gallons monthly just for lawn watering. At JEA's combined water and sewer rates (roughly $7-$10 per 1,000 gallons for typical residential customers), that's $105-$250 per month for irrigation alone.

For an average Southside or Baymeadows yard (5,000-7,000 sq ft of grass), expect $600-$1,500 annually in city water irrigation costs. Larger properties in Deerwood or Town Center can easily spend $2,000-$3,000 annually.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Many homeowners don't realize how much their lawn irrigation costs until they see summer JEA bills. Track your water consumption between winter (baseline household use) and summer (household plus irrigation) to understand your true irrigation costs.

## Cost Comparison: Well Water vs City Water for Irrigation

Let's break down the real numbers for well water vs city water Jacksonville lawn irrigation costs.

### Well Water Irrigation Costs

**Initial Investment:**
- Well drilling and installation: $3,000-$8,000 (if you don't already have a well)
- Irrigation pump and pressure tank: $800-$2,000
- Electrical work for pump: $500-$1,200

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Electricity to run pump: $20-$50 per month during irrigation season
- Annual well and pump maintenance: $100-$200
- Irrigation system maintenance (higher than city water): $150-$300 annually
- Water testing (recommended every 2-3 years): $50-$150
- Possible iron staining removal (pressure washing): $200-$400 annually

**Annual Total:** $600-$1,400 for typical Jacksonville property, plus initial installation if you don't have a well.

### City Water Irrigation Costs

**Initial Investment:**
- None (you already have city water)
- Optional: separate irrigation meter installation: $500-$1,000 (one-time fee to JEA plus plumbing costs)

**Ongoing Costs:**
- Water consumption: $400-$1,200 annually
- Sewer charges (if no separate irrigation meter): $400-$1,200 annually
- Irrigation system maintenance: $100-$200 annually

**Annual Total with combined meter:** $900-$2,600
**Annual Total with separate irrigation meter:** $500-$1,400

### Cost Comparison Summary

| Scenario | Annual Cost | Initial Investment |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Existing well water | $600-$1,400 | $0 (already have well) |
| New well installation | $600-$1,400 | $4,000-$10,000 |
| City water (combined meter) | $900-$2,600 | $0 |
| City water (separate irrigation meter) | $500-$1,400 | $500-$1,500 |

For homeowners with existing wells, well water is usually cheaper. For homeowners considering drilling a new well, the payback period is 5-10 years depending on property size and irrigation needs.

## Separate Irrigation Meters: The JEA Solution

If you have city water but want to reduce irrigation costs, JEA offers separate irrigation meters. This is the best of both worlds for many Jacksonville homeowners.

### How Separate Irrigation Meters Work

A separate irrigation meter tracks water used solely for outdoor irrigation. JEA charges for water consumption from this meter but doesn't add sewer charges—because irrigation water doesn't enter the sewer system.

You have two meters: your regular household meter for indoor water use (water plus sewer charges), and your irrigation meter for outdoor use (water charges only, no sewer).

This effectively cuts irrigation water costs in half by eliminating sewer charges on water that never goes down the drain.

### Installation Requirements

Installing a separate irrigation meter requires plumbing modifications to isolate irrigation supply from household supply, JEA inspection and approval, meter installation fee ($300-$600 to JEA), and plumbing labor costs ($300-$1,000 depending on complexity).

Total installation costs typically run $500-$1,500. For homeowners spending $150+ monthly on summer irrigation with combined meters, this pays for itself in 1-2 years.

Not every property can accommodate separate irrigation meters. Older homes with certain plumbing configurations may require extensive replumbing that doesn't make financial sense. JEA can assess feasibility during a consultation.

### Usage Requirements

JEA requires that irrigation meters are used only for irrigation and other non-potable outdoor uses—no filling swimming pools, no washing cars, no household use. They audit irrigation meter usage and will fine homeowners who abuse the system by using irrigation meters for indoor purposes.

This makes sense—the discount exists because that water doesn't enter the sewer system. Using irrigation-metered water for purposes that do create sewage violates the program terms.

## Well Water Testing and Treatment

If you have well water, periodic testing helps you understand what you're working with and whether treatment makes sense.

### Recommended Testing

Test your Jacksonville-area well water every 2-3 years for basic parameters including iron content, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, sulfur, and bacteria (if using well water for household purposes).

UF/IFAS Extension offices in Duval, Clay, and St. Johns counties can recommend certified water testing labs. Costs run $50-$150 for comprehensive irrigation water analysis.

Testing is especially important if you notice grass problems—yellowing, poor growth, unusual patterns—that might relate to water quality rather than soil or pest issues.

### Treatment Options: When They Make Sense

**Iron Filtration:**

Iron filters or oxidizing systems remove iron before it reaches irrigation lines, eliminating orange staining on hardscapes. These systems cost $800-$2,500 installed and require maintenance.

For well water with very high iron (above 3.0 ppm), and homeowners concerned about staining on expensive hardscaping or premium home exteriors, iron filtration can make sense.

But here's the reality: most Jacksonville homeowners don't treat irrigation well water. The cost of iron filtration systems plus ongoing maintenance exceeds the cost of periodic pressure washing to remove staining. And remember, iron in irrigation water actually benefits grass color.

**Water Softeners:**

Water softeners remove calcium and magnesium (hardness), but softened water should not be used on lawns. The sodium used in softening processes harms grass and accumulates in soil.

If you have a household water softener for indoor use, make sure your irrigation system draws from the well before the softener, not after it. Never irrigate with softened water.

**pH Adjustment:**

If well water pH is extremely high (above 8.0) or extremely low (below 5.5), causing nutrient availability problems, you have two options: treat the water or amend the soil. For irrigation purposes, soil amendment with sulfur (to lower pH) or lime (to raise pH) is usually more practical than treating thousands of gallons of irrigation water.

## Well Pump Sizing for Lawn Irrigation

If you have well water—or you're considering drilling a well for irrigation—pump sizing matters.

### Calculating Irrigation Demand

Typical Jacksonville residential irrigation systems require 15-25 gallons per minute (GPM) to run a full irrigation zone. If your system has 6 zones, you're not running them simultaneously—you're running one zone at a time.

Your well pump needs to supply enough water to run the largest irrigation zone effectively, typically 15-20 GPM for most residential systems. A standard 3/4 HP or 1 HP submersible well pump provides this capacity.

### Pump Capacity Considerations

Well pump capacity depends on well depth, aquifer recharge rate, and static water level. A professional well driller tests these factors before recommending pump size.

Most Jacksonville-area wells drilled for residential irrigation use are 80-150 feet deep, tapping the shallow portion of the Floridan Aquifer. These wells typically support 15-25 GPM continuous pumping—adequate for residential irrigation.

If you're irrigating large properties in St. Johns County or Clay County (more than 15,000 sq ft of grass), discuss irrigation demand with your well driller upfront. You may need a higher-capacity pump or larger pressure tank to handle the load.

## Choosing Between Well Water and City Water for Your Jacksonville Lawn

If you have a choice between well water and city water for irrigation, which should you choose?

### When Well Water Makes Sense

Well water makes sense if you already have a well on your property (no upfront drilling costs), you have a large property where city water irrigation costs would be substantial ($1,500+ annually), you don't mind iron staining or you have minimal hardscape exposed to irrigation overspray, and you're comfortable with slightly higher irrigation system maintenance.

For rural properties in Middleburg, Fruit Cove, or outlying Clay and Nassau county areas, well water is often the only practical option. The infrastructure exists, the water is abundant, and the costs are manageable.

### When City Water Makes Sense

City water makes sense if you have city water available and property size is small to medium (irrigation costs under $1,000 annually), you want minimal maintenance and clean hardscapes (no iron staining), you prefer consistent water quality and predictable costs, and you're willing to install a separate irrigation meter to minimize costs.

For urban Jacksonville properties in San Marco, Riverside, Avondale, or the beaches, city water with a separate irrigation meter offers simplicity and reasonable costs.

### The Hybrid Approach

Some Jacksonville homeowners use both: city water for household use (consistent quality, no treatment needed), and well water specifically for irrigation (lower cost, no sewer charges, high volume available).

This requires separate systems—well pump, separate irrigation piping, backflow prevention—but provides maximum flexibility and cost control. The upfront investment is higher but makes sense for large properties in areas where both options exist, like parts of Mandarin, Southside, or St. Johns County.

## Common Questions About Jacksonville Irrigation Water

**Will well water iron harm my grass?**
No. The iron in Northeast Florida well water is beneficial for grass color, not harmful. Staining affects hardscapes and structures, but grass doesn't suffer from iron-rich irrigation.

**Can I use well water if my grass is yellowing?**
Yes, but test your water pH. Extremely alkaline well water (pH above 8.0) can cause nutrient deficiencies. If pH is normal, yellowing likely relates to soil nutrients, pests, or disease—not water source.

**How do I remove iron staining from my driveway?**
Pressure washing removes iron staining, as do commercial iron stain removers (oxalic acid-based products). Prevention is difficult—iron removal systems for irrigation water are expensive, and most Jacksonville homeowners just accept periodic cleaning.

**Is city water chlorine bad for grass?**
No. Chlorine concentrations in JEA city water are too low to harm grass. The chlorine dissipates quickly after irrigation, and grass doesn't absorb harmful amounts.

**Should I filter my irrigation water?**
Standard irrigation system filters (120-200 mesh screen filters) protect system components from debris. You don't need additional filtration for grass health unless water testing reveals specific problems.

## Making Your Decision

The well water vs city water Jacksonville lawn question rarely has a one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on your property location, irrigation system size, budget, and priorities.

Well water offers cost advantages and abundant supply but requires higher maintenance and accepts cosmetic iron staining. City water offers convenience and clean operation but costs more, especially without separate irrigation meters.

Most homeowners work with whatever water source they have—if your property has a well, use it for irrigation. If you're on city water, consider a separate irrigation meter to minimize costs. Few people drill new wells solely for irrigation unless properties are large and city water costs are substantial.
