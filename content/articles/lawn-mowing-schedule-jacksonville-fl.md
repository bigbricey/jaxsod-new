# Lawn Mowing Schedule for Jacksonville, FL

If you're new to Jacksonville or new to lawn care, you might assume mowing follows a simple weekly schedule year-round. That assumption will have you either overworking yourself in winter or falling hopelessly behind during the spring growth surge. Northeast Florida's subtropical climate creates dramatic seasonal swings in grass growth rates, and your mowing schedule needs to match.

We've been installing and maintaining lawns across Duval, Clay, St. Johns, and Nassau counties for 37 years. We've seen how St. Augustine explodes in April, how Bermuda requires near-daily mowing in May, and how Bahia cruises along steadily regardless of season. Understanding these patterns will save you hours of unnecessary work and prevent the costly mistakes that come from mowing at the wrong frequency.

In this guide, we're breaking down a complete month-by-month lawn mowing schedule for Jacksonville, tailored to each grass type, with adjustments for rainfall, fertilization, and seasonal growth patterns. Whether you're doing it yourself or hiring a service, this is the schedule that works in the First Coast climate.

## How Jacksonville's Climate Affects Grass Growth

Before we get into the monthly schedule, let's establish why Jacksonville is different from other parts of the country—and even other parts of Florida.

We sit in USDA Hardiness Zones 9a and 9b, which means mild winters with occasional frosts (typically 1-3 nights below 32°F) and long, hot, humid summers. Our average annual rainfall is around 52 inches, but it's not evenly distributed. We get about 60% of that rain between June and September, which fuels explosive summer growth despite the heat.

**Key climate factors affecting your mowing schedule:**

- **No true dormancy for most grasses:** St. Augustine, Zoysia, and Bahia stay green year-round but slow dramatically in winter. Bermuda goes dormant and browns out unless overseeded.
- **Spring growth surge:** Late February through May is the most aggressive growth period. You'll mow more in those 14 weeks than the entire rest of the year combined.
- **Summer slowdown (with exceptions):** Despite the heat, growth actually slows slightly in July and August due to heat stress—except after rain, when you'll see another growth spike.
- **Hurricane season disruption:** June through November, tropical systems bring heavy rain and wind. Expect to adjust your schedule around storms.
- **Pleasant fall:** October and November are Jacksonville's sweet spot—warm, less humid, consistent growth without the spring frenzy.

Bottom line: Your lawn mowing schedule in Jacksonville needs to be flexible, not rigid.

## Growth Rates by Grass Type and Season

Different grasses respond differently to Jacksonville's seasonal changes. Here's how the four most common Northeast Florida grasses behave throughout the year:

### St. Augustine (Floratam, Palmetto, CitraBlue, ProVista)

**Peak growth:** March through June, then again in September-October
**Slowest growth:** December through February
**Average annual mowing frequency:** 32-40 times

St. Augustine is the most popular grass in Jacksonville for good reason—it handles shade, stays green year-round, and tolerates our sandy soil. But it's also a vigorous grower during warm months. Floratam, in particular, can grow 2-3 inches per week during the spring surge.

### Bermuda (TifTuf, Celebration, Tifway 419, Bimini)

**Peak growth:** April through August
**Slowest growth:** Dormant November through February
**Average annual mowing frequency:** 40-55 times (if you maintain it properly)

Bermuda is the highest-maintenance grass in Jacksonville—not because it's difficult, but because it grows aggressively and requires frequent mowing to look good. Sports fields and golf courses use Bermuda precisely because it tolerates constant cutting. If you're not willing to mow 2-3 times per week in peak season, Bermuda isn't for you.

### Zoysia (Empire, Zeon, Icon, Palisades)

**Peak growth:** April through September
**Slowest growth:** December through February
**Average annual mowing frequency:** 28-35 times

Zoysia is the Goldilocks grass—moderate growth rate, good drought tolerance, fewer pest issues than St. Augustine. It's gaining popularity in Nocatee, Ponte Vedra, and other upscale neighborhoods because it's lower maintenance than Bermuda but denser and more attractive than Bahia.

### Bahia (Argentine, Pensacola)

**Peak growth:** May through September
**Slowest growth:** January through March
**Average annual mowing frequency:** 25-32 times

Bahia is Jacksonville's "set it and forget it" grass. It's common along roadsides, in pastures, and in low-maintenance residential lawns. Growth is steady but not explosive. The trade-off is those tall seed stalks that pop up constantly—you'll be mowing partly just to knock down seed heads, not necessarily because the grass is too tall.

## Month-by-Month Jacksonville Mowing Schedule

Here's your detailed guide to mowing frequency throughout the year. We've included typical growth patterns, weather considerations, and special notes for each month.

### January: Winter Minimum

**St. Augustine:** Every 2-3 weeks (or not at all)
**Bermuda:** None (dormant and brown)
**Zoysia:** Every 2-3 weeks (or not at all)
**Bahia:** Every 2-3 weeks

January is Jacksonville's coldest month, with average lows around 42°F. Your warm-season grasses are in semi-dormancy or full dormancy. St. Augustine and Zoysia will still be green but growing so slowly you might not mow all month.

**Special considerations:**
- If we have an unusually warm January (happens about one year in three), you might need to mow once or twice
- Don't mow if frost is on the grass—wait until it melts
- Good month for mower maintenance: sharpen blades, change oil, replace spark plugs

### February: First Signs of Life

**St. Augustine:** Every 2-3 weeks (late month)
**Bermuda:** None (still dormant)
**Zoysia:** Every 2-3 weeks (late month)
**Bahia:** Every 2 weeks

By late February, soil temperatures start climbing above 60°F and grass begins breaking dormancy. You'll notice St. Augustine greening up and starting to grow. Southern-exposed areas in Southside and Baymeadows wake up first; shaded areas in Riverside and San Marco lag by a week or two.

**Special considerations:**
- Apply pre-emergent herbicide mid-month (before soil hits 55°F for 3+ consecutive days)
- First mowing of the season should be at standard height—don't scalp St. Augustine or Zoysia
- If you have Bermuda and plan to overseed with ryegrass, that window closed in October; now you just wait for green-up in April

### March: The Spring Surge Begins

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 7-10 days (if breaking dormancy) or still dormant
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

March is when Jacksonville lawns wake up in earnest. Average highs climb into the mid-70s, we get our first real rain, and grass growth accelerates rapidly. By mid-March, you're on a weekly mowing schedule for St. Augustine and Zoysia.

**Special considerations:**
- This is your first spring fertilization month (early March for St. Augustine, late March for Bermuda)
- Mow before you fertilize, then wait 24-48 hours after application before mowing again
- Watch for spring weeds like dollarweed and spurge—spot-treat as needed
- Bermuda will green up late in the month; start mowing once it's 50% green

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** If you only mow once a week in March, you'll violate the one-third rule by early April. Better to mow every 5-7 days starting now.

### April: Peak Growth Mode

**St. Augustine:** Every 5-7 days
**Bermuda:** Every 3-5 days
**Zoysia:** Every 5-7 days
**Bahia:** Every 7-10 days

April through May is the most intense mowing period of the Jacksonville year. Temperatures are in the low-80s, we're getting regular rainfall (not yet the afternoon thunderstorm pattern of summer), and grass is growing at maximum rates. Bermuda owners will be mowing twice a week or more.

**Special considerations:**
- If you go on vacation, arrange for someone to mow—letting grass get away from you now creates problems
- Bahia seed stalks will appear constantly; mow them down or bag them if you don't want seeds spreading
- Spring is ideal for addressing bare patches with sod plugs (contact us for small patch repairs)
- Sharpen your mower blade mid-month; you're putting serious hours on it

### May: Still Growing Strong

**St. Augustine:** Every 5-7 days
**Bermuda:** Every 3-5 days
**Zoysia:** Every 5-7 days
**Bahia:** Every 7-10 days

May continues the growth frenzy from April. Average highs reach the upper-80s, and we're transitioning into the summer rain pattern—which means sporadic heavy downpours that fuel another growth spurt every time.

**Special considerations:**
- Second fertilization application for most grasses (slow-release formula)
- Don't mow in the afternoon heat (90°F+); early morning or evening is better for you and the grass
- If you're installing new sod, late May is your last good window before summer heat; wait until fall if you miss it

### June: Summer Heat Arrives

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 4-5 days
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

June marks the official start of summer and the unofficial start of Jacksonville's rainy season. Average highs hit 91°F, humidity climbs to 80%+, and afternoon thunderstorms become a daily occurrence. Growth continues strong, but heat stress starts affecting grass—especially St. Augustine.

**Special considerations:**
- Raise your mowing height by half an inch to provide root shade and improve drought tolerance
- Hurricane season begins June 1; have a plan for post-storm cleanup
- Chinch bugs peak now through August—scout for damage in sunny areas
- Be prepared to adjust mowing schedule around rain; you might mow twice in one week after heavy rain, then skip a week during a dry stretch

### July: The Hottest Month

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 5-7 days
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

July is Jacksonville's hottest month, with average highs around 92°F and "feels like" temperatures often exceeding 100°F. Grass growth actually slows slightly compared to spring despite the heat—the plant is in survival mode, not growth mode. But after each afternoon thunderstorm, you'll see a growth spike.

**Special considerations:**
- Avoid heavy nitrogen fertilization in peak heat (light applications only)
- Watch for brown patch and gray leaf spot fungus, especially in St. Augustine
- Mow in the coolest part of the day (before 9am or after 6pm)
- Keep mower blade sharp—dull cuts in this heat invite disease

### August: Continuing the Grind

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 5-7 days
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

August continues July's pattern—hot, humid, daily thunderstorms, moderate growth. The grass is stressed, you're tired of mowing, and everyone's ready for fall. Push through; October is coming.

**Special considerations:**
- Peak hurricane activity month; be ready to pick up branches and debris before mowing after a storm
- Not the time to install new sod unless absolutely necessary (high failure risk in August heat)
- Irrigation system should be working efficiently; dry spots will show up quickly in this heat
- Brown patch disease peaks in August humidity; treat at first sign of circular brown patches

### September: First Signs of Relief

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 5-7 days
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

September brings the first hints of fall—not in temperature (still hot) but in the quality of the heat. It's slightly less oppressive, nights start cooling into the low-70s, and grass responds with renewed growth. St. Augustine, in particular, has a second growth surge in September and October.

**Special considerations:**
- Fall fertilization (September or October depending on grass type)
- Good time to address summer damage—bare patches, thinned areas, etc.
- Continue hurricane vigilance through November 30
- Start planning fall lawn renovations or sod installation (October-November is ideal)

### October: Jacksonville's Best Lawn Month

**St. Augustine:** Every 7-10 days
**Bermuda:** Every 5-7 days (or none if dormancy starting)
**Zoysia:** Every 7-10 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

October is when Jacksonville lawns look their best. Temperatures drop into the low-80s, humidity finally decreases, we're past the worst hurricane risk, and grass is still actively growing. If you're going to invite the neighbors over for a backyard gathering, October is the month.

**Special considerations:**
- Best month for sod installation (along with November)
- Final fall fertilization—potassium-heavy formula to prepare for winter
- Consider overseeding Bermuda with annual ryegrass if you want green all winter (optional)
- Apply pre-emergent for winter weeds mid-month
- Bermuda starts going dormant late in the month if we get cool nights

### November: Slowing Down

**St. Augustine:** Every 10-14 days
**Bermuda:** None (dormant) or weekly if overseeded
**Zoysia:** Every 10-14 days
**Bahia:** Every 10-14 days

November is the transition to winter. Growth slows considerably as temperatures drop into the 70s and we get our first cold fronts (though rarely frost yet). You'll notice grass greening up after each warm spell and slowing again after each cool spell.

**Special considerations:**
- Excellent month for sod installation (along with October)
- Reduced irrigation needed; adjust schedule to match cooler temps
- Leaf management becomes relevant in shaded neighborhoods like Riverside and Avondale
- End of hurricane season (November 30)
- Bermuda is brown and dormant unless overseeded; no mowing needed until spring

### December: Winter Dormancy Begins

**St. Augustine:** Every 2-3 weeks (or not at all)
**Bermuda:** None (dormant) or weekly if overseeded
**Zoysia:** Every 2-3 weeks (or not at all)
**Bahia:** Every 2-3 weeks

December is Jacksonville's quietest lawn month. We typically see our first frost (though not every year), and grass growth nearly stops. St. Augustine and Zoysia stay green but barely grow. Bermuda is brown and fully dormant.

**Special considerations:**
- Good month for equipment maintenance before spring surge
- Plan and budget for spring projects (sod installation, irrigation upgrades, etc.)
- If we have an unusually warm December, you might mow once or twice
- Don't fertilize dormant or semi-dormant grass

## Adjusting Your Schedule for Rainfall

Jacksonville's rainfall is unpredictable. We might get 8 inches in a week during hurricane season, then go three weeks with no rain. Your mowing schedule needs to flex accordingly.

**After heavy rain (2+ inches):**
- Wait at least 24 hours for soil to dry enough to prevent rutting
- Expect accelerated growth 3-5 days later
- You might need to mow mid-week if you normally mow weekends

**During dry stretches:**
- Grass slows dramatically without irrigation
- You can often skip a week between mowings
- Don't mow stressed, drought-affected grass shorter than normal—raise height if anything

**During rain patterns (daily afternoon storms):**
- Mow in the morning after dew dries
- Accept that you'll sometimes mow damp grass (not ideal, but reality)
- Clean mower deck more frequently to prevent rust and buildup

## Mowing After Fertilization

Timing your mowing around fertilization applications maximizes effectiveness and minimizes waste.

**Best practice sequence:**
1. Mow the lawn 1-2 days before fertilizing (removes excess blade tissue, allows fertilizer to reach soil)
2. Apply fertilizer to mowed lawn
3. Water in the fertilizer (if using granular, which you should be in Jacksonville)
4. Wait 24-48 hours before mowing again (gives fertilizer time to absorb)

If you mow immediately after fertilizing, you'll blow granules around with the mower, reducing effectiveness and potentially burning areas that receive concentrated product. Worse, you'll track fertilizer onto driveways and sidewalks, where it washes into storm drains—not good for the St. Johns River or local waterways.

Most Jacksonville lawn services coordinate mowing and fertilization schedules. If you're doing both yourself, plan ahead.

## Holiday Lawn Prep

Jacksonville hosts plenty of outdoor gatherings, and your lawn needs to look good for the big days. Here's when to mow for maximum appearance:

**Easter (March/April):** Mow 2-3 days before; grass will be standing perfectly upright
**Memorial Day (late May):** Mow day-of in the morning if weather allows; peak growing season
**July 4th:** Mow 2 days before; too close to the holiday risks heat stress on you, not the grass
**Labor Day (early September):** Mow 2-3 days before; grass still growing actively
**Thanksgiving (November):** Mow 3-4 days before; growth is slow, so timing isn't critical
**Christmas/New Year's:** Probably doesn't need mowing; if it does, mow 2-3 days before

The "mow 2-3 days before" rule gives grass time to stand back up after mowing (it lays down slightly under the mower deck) and presents the most uniform appearance.

## Equipment Maintenance Schedule

Your mower is only as good as its maintenance. Here's the schedule that keeps equipment running through Jacksonville's demanding growing season:

**Every 8-10 mowing hours (monthly during peak season):**
- Sharpen blade
- Check tire pressure
- Inspect belt tension

**Every 25 mowing hours (quarterly):**
- Change oil
- Replace air filter
- Clean mower deck thoroughly
- Lubricate moving parts

**Annually (winter):**
- Replace spark plug
- Replace fuel filter
- Drain old gas and replace with fresh
- Full inspection and tune-up

Neglect maintenance, and you'll be dealing with a dead mower mid-May when grass is growing 3 inches per week. Not a good time to be without equipment.

## Professional Mowing Service Costs in Jacksonville

If the schedule we've outlined sounds like more work than you want to take on, professional mowing services are widely available across Northeast Florida. Here's what to expect:

**Standard residential service (5,000-8,000 sq ft):**
- Per-cut rate: $35-$50
- Monthly contract rate: $140-$180/month (April-October)
- Annual contract rate: $1,200-$1,800/year

**Large lot service (10,000-15,000 sq ft):**
- Per-cut rate: $60-$90
- Monthly contract rate: $220-$320/month (peak season)

**What's included:**
- Mowing at proper height for grass type
- String trimming around beds, fences, and obstacles
- Edging along sidewalks and driveways
- Blowing clippings off hard surfaces
- Consistent weekly or bi-weekly schedule

**What's typically NOT included:**
- Fertilization (separate service, often add $50-$80 per application)
- Weed control (separate or bundled in full-service plans)
- Irrigation management
- Pest control
- Seasonal cleanup (leaves, storm debris)

Most services offer bundled plans that combine mowing, fertilization, weed control, and pest management for $200-$400/month depending on lot size. Shop around—there's significant competition in Jacksonville, especially in growing areas like Nocatee, Fruit Cove, and Fleming Island.

## DIY vs. Professional Mowing: The Real Cost Comparison

Let's break down what mowing actually costs when you do it yourself:

**DIY costs (annual):**
- Mower purchase (amortized over 5 years): $400-$800/year
- Gas and oil: $150-$250/year
- Maintenance (blades, filters, repairs): $100-$200/year
- Your time (35-45 mowings x 45-60 minutes): 26-45 hours/year
- **Total cash cost:** $650-$1,250/year
- **Total time cost:** 26-45 hours

**Professional service costs (annual):**
- Weekly service April-October, bi-weekly November-March: $1,400-$2,000/year
- Your time: 0 hours

Is it worth paying an extra $750-$1,000/year to get your weekends back? For many Jacksonville homeowners—especially those with large lots, physically demanding jobs, or better uses for their time—absolutely.

For others, mowing is relaxing, provides exercise, and represents pride of ownership. There's no wrong answer; just know the real costs of each option.

## Common Scheduling Mistakes Jacksonville Homeowners Make

After 37 years, we've seen these patterns repeatedly:

1. **Mowing on a rigid weekly schedule regardless of growth:** Grass doesn't grow on a calendar. Mow when it needs it, not when the calendar says to.

2. **Skipping mowing during vacation:** Two weeks unmowed in May means you'll violate the one-third rule when you return. Hire a neighborhood kid or ask a friend.

3. **Mowing too frequently in winter:** If grass hasn't grown, don't mow it. You're just wasting time and gas.

4. **Not adjusting for grass type:** Bermuda requires twice the frequency of Bahia. Know what you have and adjust accordingly.

5. **Mowing right after fertilizing:** Wait 24-48 hours. Be patient.

6. **Using the same schedule as your neighbor:** Your neighbor might have Bahia; you might have St. Augustine. Your schedules should be different.

7. **Not accounting for rainfall:** Three inches of rain means accelerated growth. Adjust.

The best schedule is flexible, observation-based, and tuned to your specific grass, your specific yard, and Jacksonville's specific weather patterns in a given week.

## When Professional Help Makes Sense

You should consider hiring a professional mowing service if:

- **You have more than half an acre:** That's a lot of mowing, especially during the spring surge
- **You travel frequently:** Consistency matters, especially April-June
- **You have physical limitations:** No shame in this; mowing is physically demanding work in Jacksonville heat
- **Your equipment keeps breaking:** Sometimes the cost of a service is less than constantly repairing old equipment
- **You value your time highly:** If you earn $50+/hour professionally, paying someone $40 to mow while you work an extra hour is net positive
- **Your lawn looks bad despite your efforts:** A professional knows proper height, frequency, and technique

At Jax Sod, we install the lawn; you maintain it (or hire someone to maintain it). But we're always available to consult on issues, recommend services, or provide replacement sod if your lawn declines beyond recovery.

## Planning Your Year

Here's how we recommend Jacksonville homeowners approach lawn mowing on an annual basis:

**January-February:** Plan and budget for the year; maintain equipment; enjoy the break
**March-June:** The busy season—mow frequently, stay on top of it, don't fall behind
**July-August:** Grind through it; this is the hardest stretch physically
**September-October:** Enjoy the best mowing season; plan fall projects
**November-December:** Wind down; occasional mowing as needed; prep for next year

If you can stay on schedule March through June, the rest of the year is manageable. Fall behind during the spring surge, and you'll struggle all season.

## Conclusion: Flexibility Within Structure

A lawn mowing schedule isn't a rigid calendar—it's a flexible framework that adapts to grass type, season, rainfall, temperature, and your specific Jacksonville microclimate. St. Augustine in shaded Riverside behaves differently from Bermuda in sunny Baymeadows. Zoysia in Nocatee's sandy soil grows differently from Bahia in Orange Park's clay mix.

The baseline schedule we've provided—adjusted by grass type and month—works for the majority of Northeast Florida lawns. But the best mowing schedule is the one that keeps your grass between the ideal maintenance height for your variety. For St. Augustine, that means never letting it get above 6 inches (mow at 4"). For Bermuda, never above 2.25 inches (mow at 1.5"). And so on.

Master the schedule, adjust as needed, and you'll have a healthy, attractive lawn year-round with the minimum necessary effort. That's the goal: maximum results, minimum wasted time.
