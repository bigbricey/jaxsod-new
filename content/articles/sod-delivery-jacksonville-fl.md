# Sod Delivery in Jacksonville, FL: Everything You Need to Know

Whether you're replacing a tired, weedy lawn or starting fresh on a new construction lot, getting sod delivered to your Jacksonville home is the fastest way to a beautiful yard. But there's more to it than just calling a number and hoping for the best. The decisions you make before that truck shows up — how much to order, when to schedule delivery, how to prepare your yard — make the difference between a smooth installation and a stressful mess.

After delivering sod across Duval, St. Johns, Clay, and Nassau counties for years, we've seen every scenario. The homeowner who ordered 20% too little and ended up with a bare strip along the fence. The one who scheduled delivery for a Friday afternoon with no plan to install until Monday (spoiler: the sod didn't survive the weekend). And plenty of folks who did it right — planned ahead, prepped the yard, and had a gorgeous lawn by sundown.

This guide walks you through everything so you end up in that last group.

## How Much Sod Do You Actually Need?

This is the first question everyone asks, and getting it wrong is expensive. Order too little and you're stuck with gaps. Order too much and you've got leftover pallets sitting in your driveway going bad.

### Measuring Your Yard

You need the total square footage of the area you want to sod. Here's how to figure it out:

1. **Rectangular areas:** Multiply length × width. A front yard that's 40 feet wide and 25 feet deep = 1,000 square feet.
2. **Irregular shapes:** Break the area into rectangles and triangles, measure each, and add them together.
3. **Subtract hardscape:** Don't count driveways, walkways, patios, or garden beds.

For a quick calculation, use our [sod calculator](/calculators/sod-calculator) — plug in your measurements and it'll tell you exactly how many pallets you need.

### The 5–10% Overage Rule

Always order 5–10% more sod than your measurements indicate. You'll need extra for:

- **Cutting around curves, beds, and walkways** — those edge pieces create waste
- **Odd-shaped areas** that don't fit standard sod pieces neatly
- **Small errors in measurement** — yards are rarely perfect rectangles
- **Damaged pieces on the pallet** — rare, but it happens

For a 3,000 square foot yard, order 3,150–3,300 square feet. It's far cheaper to have a few extra pieces than to be short and scrambling.

### Sod Pallet Sizes

In the Jacksonville area, sod typically comes on pallets covering approximately 400–500 square feet, depending on the variety and the farm. Individual pieces are usually rectangular slabs. When you order from Jax Sod, we'll tell you exactly how much coverage each pallet provides for the grass type you're getting.

## Choosing the Right Grass Type for Delivery

Before you order, make sure you're getting the right variety for your yard. The wrong grass in the wrong conditions leads to problems no matter how well you install it.

### St. Augustine Grass

The most popular lawn grass in Jacksonville by far. Thick, wide blades with a deep green color. Handles our heat and humidity well, tolerates some shade, and fills in aggressively. Best for most residential lawns in Northeast Florida.

**Good for:** Full sun to moderate shade, most Jacksonville soil types
**Not ideal for:** Deep shade under dense oaks, areas with heavy foot traffic

### Zoysia Grass

Tighter texture than St. Augustine, more drought-tolerant once established, and handles foot traffic better. [Zoysia is gaining popularity](/articles/zoysia-grass-care-guide-jacksonville) in Jacksonville neighborhoods like Ponte Vedra, San Marco, and Riverside where homeowners want a manicured, carpet-like lawn.

**Good for:** Full sun, moderate shade, high-traffic areas
**Not ideal for:** Heavy shade, impatient homeowners (fills in slower than St. Augustine)

### Bermuda Grass

The toughest grass for full-sun Jacksonville lawns. Handles heat, drought, and heavy traffic like a champ. Popular for sports fields, but also works great for residential yards that get all-day sun.

**Good for:** Full sun, high traffic, sandy soils
**Not ideal for:** Any shade at all — Bermuda needs direct sun

## When to Schedule Sod Delivery in Jacksonville

Timing matters more than most people realize. Two things to consider: time of year and day of the week.

### Best Seasons for Sod Installation

You can install sod in Jacksonville year-round, but some seasons are better than others:

- **Spring (March–May):** The sweet spot. Warm soil temperatures kick-start root growth, and there's usually enough rain to supplement your watering. This is the most popular time for sod delivery in Jacksonville.
- **Early Fall (September–October):** Another great window. The worst summer heat has passed, but there's still plenty of warm weather for roots to establish before winter.
- **Summer (June–August):** Works fine, but you'll need to water aggressively. Jacksonville's summer heat can stress fresh sod quickly. Morning delivery and immediate installation are critical.
- **Winter (December–February):** Sod can be installed, but root growth slows significantly. The grass will survive but won't establish as fast. Avoid installing right before a hard freeze.

For more detail on seasonal timing, read our guide on the [best time to lay sod in Jacksonville](/articles/best-time-lay-sod-jacksonville-fl).

### Day of the Week Matters

This is the tip most delivery guides miss: **schedule your sod delivery for a day when you can install it immediately.**

Fresh sod is a living product. From the moment it's cut at the farm, it starts to decline. On a Jacksonville summer day with temps in the 90s, sod sitting on a pallet in your driveway can begin to heat up internally within hours. The pieces in the center of the pallet — where there's no airflow — can reach temperatures that damage or kill the grass.

**Rules of thumb:**

- **Install within 12 hours of delivery** during summer (June–September)
- **Install within 24 hours** during spring and fall
- **Install within 36–48 hours** during winter (only if temperatures are cool)
- **Never let sod sit over a weekend** unless you're installing in winter

Schedule delivery for early morning so you have the full day to install. If you're DIYing and can only work weekends, schedule a Saturday morning delivery.

## Preparing for Sod Delivery Day

The work you do before the truck arrives determines how smoothly everything goes.

### 1. Prep Your Yard First

Your soil should be ready for sod **before** delivery, not after. Once that truck drops pallets in your driveway, you're on the clock.

Proper soil preparation includes:

- **Removing old grass, weeds, and debris** — a clean slate is essential
- **Grading the soil** so it slopes slightly away from your house for drainage
- **Loosening the top 2–3 inches of soil** — especially important for Jacksonville's compacted sandy soils in areas like the Westside and Northside
- **Adding soil amendments** if needed — many Jacksonville yards benefit from a thin layer of topsoil or compost mixed into the native sand
- **Watering the prepared soil** lightly the day before delivery so it's moist (not muddy) when the sod arrives

Check out our [soil preparation guide](/articles/jacksonville-soil-guide-understanding-your-lawns-foundation) for detailed instructions specific to Northeast Florida soil types.

### 2. Clear the Delivery Path

The delivery truck needs to get close to your property. Before delivery day:

- **Clear the driveway** — move vehicles, trash cans, and anything else
- **Identify where you want the pallets placed** — as close to the installation area as possible
- **Note any obstacles** — low-hanging branches, narrow gates, or soft ground that could get rutted
- **Check for sprinkler heads** near the drop zone — pallets are heavy and will crush exposed irrigation heads

### 3. Mark Irrigation Heads and Utilities

Before you start cutting and laying sod, make sure you know where your irrigation lines, sprinkler heads, and any shallow utilities are located. A landscaping flag or spray paint on the ground works fine. You definitely don't want to puncture an irrigation line with a shovel during installation.

### 4. Have Your Tools Ready

If you're DIYing the installation, gather everything you'll need before the sod shows up:

- **Sharp knife or sod cutter** for trimming pieces around edges and obstacles
- **Wheelbarrow** for moving pieces from the pallet to the yard
- **Landscape rake** for final soil smoothing
- **Lawn roller** (rent one from a local equipment rental shop)
- **Garden hose or irrigation system** ready to go — you'll water each section as it's laid

## What to Expect on Delivery Day

### How Sod Arrives

Sod is delivered on pallets loaded on a flatbed truck or trailer. Depending on the quantity, a forklift or the truck's lift gate will place pallets on your driveway or the nearest accessible spot to your yard.

### Inspecting Your Sod

When the delivery arrives, take a few minutes to check the quality:

- **Color:** Should be green on top (some yellowing on the bottom of the pallet is normal due to lack of sunlight — it'll green up)
- **Moisture:** Pieces should feel moist and cool, not hot or dry
- **Smell:** Fresh sod smells like earth. If it smells sour or like ammonia, the sod has been sitting too long and is heating up
- **Roots:** The underside should show a dense mat of white or light-colored roots holding the soil together
- **Edges:** Pieces should hold together when lifted — they shouldn't fall apart or crumble

If something looks off, mention it to the delivery driver before they leave. A reputable supplier like [Jax Sod](/contact) stands behind the quality of every pallet.

### Storing Sod Temporarily

If you absolutely cannot install all the sod the same day:

- **Keep pallets in the shade** — pull them under a tree or into the garage if possible
- **Water the tops and sides** of the pallets lightly to prevent drying
- **Install the outermost pieces first** (they dry fastest) and work through the pallet
- **Don't stack pallets on top of each other** — this traps heat and kills the inner pieces faster

## Installation Basics After Delivery

A full installation guide is beyond this article's scope (we cover that in our [DIY vs. professional installation guide](/articles/diy-vs-professional-sod-installation-jacksonville)), but here are the key points:

### Laying Pattern

- Start along a straight edge — a sidewalk, driveway, or fence line
- Stagger seams like you're laying bricks — don't line up the short edges
- Push pieces tightly together without overlapping — no gaps, no overlaps
- Cut pieces with a sharp knife to fit around beds, trees, and walkways

### Water Immediately

As soon as a section is laid, water it. Don't wait until the whole yard is done. In Jacksonville's heat, the first pieces you lay can be drying out while you're still working on the far side of the yard.

### Roll the Lawn

After installation, use a water-filled lawn roller to press the sod firmly against the soil beneath it. Good soil-to-sod contact is critical for root establishment. Without it, air pockets form and the sod dries out from underneath.

### Post-Installation Watering

The next 2–3 weeks are critical. Plan to water heavily for the first few days, then gradually taper off as roots establish. Our [new sod care guide](/articles/new-sod-care-first-30-days-jacksonville) breaks down the exact watering schedule day by day.

## Common Sod Delivery Mistakes to Avoid

After thousands of deliveries, here are the mistakes we see most often:

### Ordering on a Friday with No Weekend Plan

The sod shows up Friday afternoon. You figure you'll install Saturday. But then it rains Saturday morning, your buddy who was going to help cancels, and now it's Sunday afternoon and half the sod is still on pallets. By Monday, the center pieces are yellow and hot. Don't do this.

### Not Prepping the Yard Before Delivery

If you haven't removed old grass, graded the soil, and addressed drainage issues before the sod arrives, you're going to have a bad time. Trying to prep soil with fresh sod pallets heating up in the driveway is stressful and usually results in a rushed job.

### Underestimating the Physical Work

A pallet of sod weighs roughly 1,500–2,000 pounds. Each individual piece weighs 30–40 pounds. For a 3,000 square foot yard, you're moving and placing hundreds of pieces. If you're DIYing, recruit help — this isn't a one-person job.

### Ignoring Soil Prep

Just rolling sod onto unprepared soil is like putting new carpet over a bumpy subfloor. The sod might look okay for a week, but it won't root properly, and you'll end up with an uneven, struggling lawn.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far in advance should I schedule sod delivery in Jacksonville?

During peak season (spring and early fall), schedule at least a week in advance. Summer and winter deliveries usually have more flexibility. Call [Jax Sod](/contact) and we can typically accommodate your timeline, but earlier is always better — especially if you need a specific grass variety.

### Can sod be delivered directly to my backyard?

It depends on access. If there's a gate wide enough for a forklift or clear path from the street, it may be possible. Otherwise, pallets will be placed on the driveway or the closest accessible spot. Discuss access with your supplier when ordering.

### What happens if it rains on delivery day?

Light rain is actually fine — it keeps the sod moist. Heavy rain, however, can make your prepped soil too muddy to work with and turn the installation into a slippery mess. If heavy rain is forecast, it's better to reschedule. Most suppliers will work with you on weather delays.

### How do I know if my sod was good quality when it arrived?

Quality sod is green on top, moist, cool to the touch, and has a dense root mat holding it together. It should not smell sour or feel hot. Some yellowing on the underside of pallet-center pieces is normal and will recover. Avoid any sod that's brown on top, dry and crumbly, or has a strong ammonia smell.

### Do I need to water the soil before sod delivery?

Yes — lightly. Moist soil helps the new sod establish contact and begin rooting. Don't soak the ground to the point it's muddy — that makes installation difficult and can cause the heavy sod pieces to sink unevenly. Water the prepared soil the evening before delivery so it's damp but firm when the sod arrives.
