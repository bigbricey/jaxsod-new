# St. Augustine vs Bermuda Grass: Which Is Best for Jacksonville Lawns?

If you're a Jacksonville homeowner staring at a patchy yard and wondering which grass to install, you're not alone. The two most popular warm-season turf types in Northeast Florida — St. Augustine and Bermuda grass — each bring real strengths to the table, but they perform very differently depending on your property, your lifestyle, and even your neighborhood.

After years of installing sod across Duval County and the surrounding areas, we've seen firsthand how the wrong grass choice leads to frustration, wasted money, and lawns that never quite thrive. This guide breaks down everything you need to know so you can make the right call the first time.

## Quick Comparison: St. Augustine vs Bermuda Grass in Jacksonville

Before we dive into the details, here's a side-by-side snapshot of how these two grasses stack up for our local conditions:

| Feature | St. Augustine | Bermuda Grass |
|---|---|---|
| **Shade Tolerance** | Excellent (especially Palmetto, CitraBlue) | Poor — needs 6-8 hours of direct sun |
| **Drought Resistance** | Moderate | Excellent |
| **Salt Tolerance** | Very Good | Moderate |
| **Cold Tolerance** | Moderate (damaged below 25°F) | Good (goes dormant, recovers quickly) |
| **Mowing Height** | 3.5–4 inches | 1–2 inches |
| **Mowing Frequency** | Every 7–10 days | Every 4–7 days |
| **Traffic Tolerance** | Moderate | Excellent |
| **Establishment Speed** | Moderate (sod recommended) | Fast (sod or seed) |
| **Texture** | Broad, coarse blades | Fine, dense blades |
| **Typical Cost (sod/pallet)** | $$ | $–$$ |
| **Pest Vulnerability** | Chinch bugs, gray leaf spot | Mole crickets, armyworms |
| **Best For** | Shaded yards, coastal properties | Full-sun yards, high-traffic areas |

Now let's unpack what each of these really means for your Jacksonville lawn.

## Understanding Jacksonville's Growing Conditions

Before choosing a grass type, it helps to understand what makes our local environment unique — because Northeast Florida isn't quite the same as Central Florida or the Panhandle.

### Sandy Soil

Most of Jacksonville sits on well-drained sandy soil. That's great for preventing waterlogging, but it also means nutrients leach out quickly and the ground dries out faster than clay-based soils. Both St. Augustine and Bermuda can handle sandy soil, but they respond to it differently. Bermuda's deep root system gives it an edge in dry, sandy conditions, while St. Augustine benefits from consistent irrigation and a layer of organic matter to retain moisture.

### Humidity and Heat

Our summers are brutally hot and humid — we're talking heat indexes well above 100°F from June through September. Both grasses are warm-season varieties that thrive in heat, but the humidity creates ideal conditions for fungal diseases like gray leaf spot (a common St. Augustine problem) and dollar spot (which can hit Bermuda). Proper mowing height and irrigation timing matter more here than in drier climates.

### Salt Air and Coastal Proximity

If you live in Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, Ponte Vedra, or anywhere near the Intracoastal, salt exposure is a real factor. St. Augustine is significantly more salt-tolerant than Bermuda, which is one reason you see it dominating coastal neighborhoods from Mayport down to St. Augustine (the city). Bermuda can handle some salt, but sustained salt spray or brackish irrigation water will thin it out over time.

### Winter Temperatures

Jacksonville sits in USDA Zone 9a, and while our winters are mild overall, we do get occasional hard freezes. Both grasses go semi-dormant and turn brown during winter, but Bermuda tends to brown out more completely while bouncing back aggressively in spring. St. Augustine stays greener longer into fall and can suffer real damage from prolonged freezes below 25°F — especially newer Floratam varieties.

## St. Augustine Grass: The Jacksonville Favorite

St. Augustine is the most widely installed grass in Jacksonville, and for good reason. It's the grass you see in most established neighborhoods from San Marco to Mandarin, from Riverside to Nocatee.

### Why It Works Here

St. Augustine's biggest advantage in Jacksonville is its **shade tolerance**. Most of our neighborhoods are lined with mature live oaks, magnolias, and pine trees. If your yard gets fewer than six hours of direct sunlight, Bermuda simply won't cut it — it'll thin out, develop bare patches, and eventually give way to weeds. St. Augustine varieties like **Palmetto**, **CitraBlue**, and **Seville** handle partial shade beautifully, maintaining thick coverage under tree canopies where Bermuda would fail.

It also delivers the lush, thick-bladed look that most homeowners picture when they think of a "Florida lawn." The broad, dark-green blades create a carpet-like appearance that feels distinctly tropical.

### St. Augustine Pros for NE Florida

- **Excellent shade performance** — thrives under oak canopies common throughout Jacksonville
- **Superior salt tolerance** — ideal for beach communities and properties near the Intracoastal
- **Thick growth habit** — naturally crowds out many common weeds once established
- **Stays greener in mild winters** — better curb appeal from November through February
- **Multiple variety options** — Floratam for full sun, Palmetto or CitraBlue for shade, Seville for a finer texture

### St. Augustine Cons for NE Florida

- **Chinch bug susceptibility** — these tiny pests thrive in our hot, dry conditions and can destroy entire sections of lawn in weeks if untreated
- **Higher water requirements** — needs about 1 inch of water per week, and our sandy soil drains fast
- **Gray leaf spot** — our summer humidity creates perfect conditions for this fungal disease
- **Doesn't handle heavy foot traffic well** — not the best choice if your yard doubles as a soccer field
- **Can't be established from seed** — must be installed as sod or plugs, which costs more upfront
- **Thatch buildup** — requires periodic dethatching to stay healthy

### Best St. Augustine Varieties for Jacksonville

**Floratam** is the industry standard for full-sun Jacksonville lawns. It's affordable, widely available, and has good chinch bug resistance. However, it's the least shade-tolerant St. Augustine variety — ironic, given that shade tolerance is the grass type's biggest selling point.

**Palmetto** is our go-to recommendation for yards with moderate to heavy shade. It maintains its color better in winter, tolerates shade and drought better than Floratam, and has a softer texture. If you have mature trees, Palmetto is almost always the right call.

**CitraBlue** is a newer variety developed by the University of Florida that's quickly becoming a Jacksonville favorite. It offers excellent shade tolerance, a distinctive blue-green color, tighter growth that resists thatch buildup, and improved disease resistance. We've been installing a lot of CitraBlue across Northeast Florida, and the results have been impressive.

At [Jax Sod](https://jaxsod.com), we carry all three varieties and can help you choose the right one based on a quick assessment of your yard's sun exposure and soil conditions.

## Bermuda Grass: The Sun-Loving Workhorse

Bermuda grass is the turf of choice for golf courses, athletic fields, and high-traffic commercial properties across the South — and it has a place in Jacksonville residential lawns too, under the right conditions.

### Why It Works Here

Bermuda's greatest strength is its **durability**. It establishes a deep root system — sometimes reaching 6 feet or more — that makes it exceptionally drought-tolerant once mature. In Jacksonville's sandy soil, where water drains quickly and summer droughts can last weeks, that deep root system is a genuine advantage.

It also recovers from damage faster than any other warm-season grass. If your kids, dogs, or weekend football games beat up your lawn, Bermuda will fill back in aggressively through its stolons and rhizomes. It's the most wear-resistant residential grass available in our market.

### Bermuda Grass Pros for NE Florida

- **Outstanding drought tolerance** — deep roots handle our sandy, fast-draining soil
- **Rapid recovery from damage** — fills in bare spots quickly through aggressive lateral growth
- **Excellent traffic tolerance** — perfect for active families and pets
- **Lower water requirements** — can survive on rainfall alone during most of the year once established
- **Lower mowing height** — creates a tight, manicured appearance some homeowners prefer
- **Can be established from seed** — offers a more affordable installation option for large properties
- **Strong cold recovery** — bounces back reliably after Jacksonville's occasional freezes

### Bermuda Grass Cons for NE Florida

- **Zero shade tolerance** — this is the dealbreaker for most Jacksonville yards; if you have significant tree cover, Bermuda is not the answer
- **Invasive growth** — it will creep into flower beds, driveways, sidewalk cracks, and your neighbor's yard if you don't edge aggressively
- **Higher mowing frequency** — needs mowing every 4–7 days during peak growing season to prevent scalping
- **Complete winter dormancy** — turns entirely brown from December through February, which some homeowners dislike
- **Moderate salt tolerance** — not ideal for direct oceanfront or properties irrigated with reclaimed water
- **Requires more precise mowing** — should be cut at 1–2 inches, which usually means a reel mower for best results

### Best Bermuda Varieties for Jacksonville

**Tifway 419** (commonly called "419 Bermuda") is the gold standard for residential Bermuda in our area. It's dense, dark green, and handles Jacksonville's heat and humidity well. You'll find it on most local golf courses and sports fields.

**Celebration** Bermuda is another excellent option that offers improved shade tolerance over traditional Bermuda varieties — though "improved" still means it needs at least 5–6 hours of direct sun. It also has better drought tolerance and a darker color.

**TifTuf** is a newer variety bred specifically for water conservation. It uses up to 38% less water than Tifway 419, which can make a real difference on your irrigation bill during Jacksonville's dry spring months.

## Which Grass Is Best for Your Jacksonville Neighborhood?

Your location within the Jacksonville metro often points toward one grass type over the other. Here's what we typically recommend:

### St. Augustine Is Usually Better For:

- **San Marco / San Jose** — Mature oak canopies mean heavy shade; St. Augustine is almost always the right choice
- **Riverside / Avondale / Ortega** — Historic neighborhoods with large, established trees; Palmetto or CitraBlue thrive here
- **Jacksonville Beach / Atlantic Beach / Neptune Beach** — Salt exposure makes St. Augustine the clear winner
- **Ponte Vedra / Nocatee** — Coastal influence plus HOA expectations for year-round green favor St. Augustine
- **Mandarin** — Heavy tree cover in most established subdivisions
- **Fleming Island / Orange Park** — Mature landscaping and moderate shade in many neighborhoods

### Bermuda Grass Is Usually Better For:

- **New construction in open subdivisions** — Treeless lots with full sun are Bermuda's sweet spot
- **Westside / Argyle** — Newer developments with minimal shade
- **Properties with large, open yards** — If your lot is a half-acre or more with no tree cover, Bermuda's lower water needs save real money
- **Homes with active kids and dogs** — If your backyard is basically a playground, Bermuda handles it better
- **Budget-conscious installations** — Bermuda seed or sod is typically less expensive per square foot

### The Hybrid Approach

Many Jacksonville homeowners get the best of both worlds by using **St. Augustine in shaded areas** (front yard under oaks, side yards between houses) and **Bermuda in full-sun areas** (open backyard, play areas). This is a perfectly valid approach, though the two grasses will eventually compete at their borders. Keeping a clean edge between the zones with a mowing strip or border helps.

## Cost Comparison: What You'll Actually Pay in Jacksonville

Price matters, and there are real differences between these two options. Here's what Jacksonville homeowners can expect as of 2026:

### Installation Costs

| Cost Factor | St. Augustine | Bermuda |
|---|---|---|
| **Sod per pallet (400–500 sq ft)** | $250–$350 | $200–$300 |
| **Professional installation (per sq ft)** | $1.50–$2.50 | $1.25–$2.25 |
| **Seed (Bermuda only, per 1,000 sq ft)** | N/A | $15–$30 |
| **Average 5,000 sq ft lawn (sod + install)** | $3,500–$5,500 | $2,800–$4,800 |

### Ongoing Maintenance Costs

St. Augustine typically costs more to maintain annually due to higher water requirements, more frequent fertilization needs (4–6 times per year), and targeted pest treatments for chinch bugs. Budget roughly **$1,200–$2,000 per year** for professional lawn care on a St. Augustine lawn.

Bermuda's ongoing costs are somewhat lower thanks to reduced irrigation needs, though the more frequent mowing can offset savings if you're paying a lawn service. Budget roughly **$900–$1,600 per year** for a professionally maintained Bermuda lawn.

## Maintenance Requirements: What Each Grass Demands

### Mowing

**St. Augustine** should be mowed at **3.5 to 4 inches** — never remove more than one-third of the blade height at a time. In Jacksonville's peak growing season (May through September), that means mowing every 7–10 days. Use a sharp rotary mower blade; dull blades shred St. Augustine's broad leaves and invite disease.

**Bermuda** needs to be cut at **1 to 2 inches** and mowed every **4–7 days** during summer. For the best results, a reel mower provides the clean, low cut that Bermuda prefers. Rotary mowers can work at higher settings but won't give you that golf-course look.

### Watering

**St. Augustine** needs about **1 inch of water per week**, delivered in 2–3 deep watering sessions rather than daily light sprinkles. With Jacksonville's sandy soil, morning irrigation (before 10 AM) reduces evaporation and fungal risk.

**Bermuda** can get by on **0.5–1 inch per week** once established, and its deep roots can pull moisture from well below the surface. During our typical summer afternoon thunderstorms, established Bermuda lawns often need no supplemental irrigation at all.

### Fertilization

Both grasses perform best with a consistent fertilization program. In Jacksonville's sandy soil, nutrients wash through quickly, so slow-release fertilizers are worth the extra cost.

**St. Augustine**: Apply a complete fertilizer (16-4-8 or similar) 4–6 times per year from March through October. Iron supplements help maintain dark green color without excessive growth.

**Bermuda**: Fertilize 4–5 times per year during the growing season. Bermuda is a heavier nitrogen feeder and responds well to higher-nitrogen formulas, but over-fertilizing promotes thatch buildup.

### Pest and Disease Management

In Jacksonville, **chinch bugs** are the number-one threat to St. Augustine lawns, especially during hot, dry stretches in June and July. Look for irregular brown patches that don't respond to watering — that's your warning sign. Preventive treatments in late spring can save you from expensive resodding later.

**Bermuda** is more susceptible to **mole crickets** and **armyworms** in our area. Mole crickets tunnel through sandy soil and destroy root systems, while armyworms can strip a Bermuda lawn overnight during late summer.

Both grasses can develop fungal issues in our humid climate. Proper mowing height, morning-only irrigation, and adequate air circulation are your best defenses.

## The Bottom Line: Making Your Decision

Here's our honest recommendation after installing thousands of lawns across Jacksonville:

**Choose St. Augustine if:**
- Your yard has significant shade from trees or structures
- You live near the coast or beach communities
- You want a lawn that stays greener through winter
- You prefer a lush, tropical look with broader blades
- Your yard sees moderate foot traffic

**Choose Bermuda if:**
- Your yard receives 6+ hours of direct sunlight
- You want the lowest possible water bill
- Your yard takes heavy foot traffic from kids, pets, or entertaining
- You prefer a tight, manicured, golf-course appearance
- You're working with a tighter installation budget

For most established Jacksonville neighborhoods — where live oaks, magnolias, and pines create at least partial shade — **St. Augustine remains the best all-around choice**. It handles our unique combination of shade, salt air, humidity, and sandy soil better than any other grass type available.

But if you've got a wide-open, sun-drenched lot and you want a tough, low-water lawn that can take a beating? Bermuda is hard to beat.
