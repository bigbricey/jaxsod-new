# Jacksonville Lawn Watering Restrictions: What You Need to Know

Jacksonville homeowners love a green lawn, but water isn't unlimited — and in Northeast Florida, there are real rules about when and how you can irrigate your yard. Violate them and you could face warnings, fines, or even having your irrigation privileges suspended.

The good news is that Jacksonville's watering restrictions are straightforward once you understand them. And following the rules actually benefits your lawn — the schedule is designed to promote deep root growth and reduce the disease problems that come from overwatering.

This guide breaks down the current restrictions, explains how they apply to your specific situation, and gives you practical tips for keeping your lawn healthy within the rules.

## Who Sets the Rules? Understanding SJRWMD

Jacksonville falls under the **St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD)**, one of five water management districts in Florida. The SJRWMD sets landscape irrigation restrictions for all 18 counties in its jurisdiction, including Duval, St. Johns, Clay, and Nassau counties — basically the entire Jacksonville metro area.

These aren't suggestions — they're legally enforceable regulations. The SJRWMD has the authority to issue violations and fines for non-compliance. Local utilities like JEA also enforce watering schedules and may have additional guidelines for reclaimed water customers.

## Current Watering Schedule for Jacksonville

The SJRWMD uses a **year-round, two-day-per-week** irrigation schedule for most of the year, with a slight expansion during hotter months.

### Standard Schedule (Year-Round Baseline)

Your allowed watering days are determined by your **address number**:

- **Odd-numbered addresses** (ending in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9): Water on **Wednesday and Saturday**
- **Even-numbered addresses** (ending in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8): Water on **Thursday and Sunday**
- **Non-residential properties** (HOAs, businesses, common areas): **Tuesday and Friday**

### Daylight Saving Time Adjustment (March–November)

During Daylight Saving Time (typically mid-March through early November), watering is allowed **before 10:00 AM or after 4:00 PM** on your designated days. The midday restriction prevents water from evaporating before it reaches the root zone — a real concern in Jacksonville's summer heat where pavement temperatures can hit 150°F.

### Eastern Standard Time (November–March)

During standard time, watering is allowed **before 10:00 AM or after 4:00 PM** — the same time window applies year-round.

### Important: No Watering Between 10 AM and 4 PM

This is the most commonly violated rule in Jacksonville. Irrigation systems that run at noon are wasting water to evaporation and can draw a violation notice. Adjust your irrigation timer to run between 4:00 AM and 9:00 AM for the best results — early morning watering gives the grass time to absorb moisture before the day heats up, and allows leaf blades to dry before evening (which reduces [fungal disease risk](/articles/brown-patch-fungus-jacksonville-sod)).

## Exceptions to the Standard Schedule

Not every watering situation follows the two-day rule. Here are the exceptions that Jacksonville homeowners should know about:

### New Sod, Seed, or Landscape Installation

This is the big one for customers of sod companies like Jax Sod. **Newly installed sod is exempt from the two-day-per-week restriction for 30 days after installation** (or 90 days for seed or new plantings).

During this 30-day establishment period, you can water your new sod **as needed** — which, as we describe in our [new sod care guide](/articles/new-sod-care-first-30-days-jacksonville), typically means daily watering for the first two weeks, tapering to every other day by weeks three and four.

After the 30-day window closes, you must return to the standard two-day-per-week schedule.

**Documentation:** Keep your sod installation receipt or invoice handy during the establishment period. If a code enforcement officer or water management inspector questions your watering frequency, you'll need proof of the installation date. When Jax Sod installs your lawn, we provide documentation that covers this.

### Hand Watering

You can water by hand (holding a hose with a shut-off nozzle) **any day, any time**. This applies to spot-watering dry areas, watering container plants, and maintaining garden beds. The restriction is specifically on **automatic irrigation systems and unattended hose-end sprinklers**.

This means if you notice a dry spot on a non-watering day, you can absolutely grab the hose and water it yourself — just hold the hose and use a nozzle.

### Micro-Irrigation and Drip Systems

**Low-volume micro-irrigation** (drip lines, micro-sprayers, bubblers) used for garden beds, trees, and shrubs can operate **any day** as long as it runs during the allowed time window (before 10 AM or after 4 PM). This exemption does not apply to sprinkler systems watering turf.

### Reclaimed Water

If you're on a **JEA reclaimed water** system (common in newer Jacksonville developments like Nocatee, Durbin Crossing, Bartram Park, and parts of the Southside), your watering rules may differ slightly. JEA has historically allowed more flexibility for reclaimed water customers because reclaimed water doesn't draw from the freshwater supply.

However, JEA has periodically implemented its own restrictions for reclaimed water customers, particularly in areas like Nocatee where demand has outpaced supply. Check JEA's current reclaimed water schedule for your specific area — it changes seasonally and by zone.

### Fountains, Car Washing, and Pressure Washing

Water features like fountains that recirculate are allowed. Vehicle washing with a hose requires a shut-off nozzle. Pressure washing for maintenance is allowed any day but should use water efficiently.

## How the Restrictions Affect Your Lawn Care

### Can You Keep a Healthy Lawn on Two Days Per Week?

Absolutely — and in many cases, twice-weekly watering produces a healthier lawn than daily irrigation. Here's why:

**Deep, infrequent watering encourages deep roots.** When you water your Jacksonville lawn twice a week and apply enough water each session to wet the soil 4–6 inches deep, the grass roots chase that moisture downward. Deep roots mean a more drought-tolerant, resilient lawn.

Compare that to daily shallow watering, where roots stay near the surface because they never need to reach deeper. Those shallow-rooted lawns wilt the moment you skip a day or your irrigation system hiccups.

For most Jacksonville lawns, two well-timed watering sessions per week provide adequate moisture throughout the year — especially during the wet season (June–September) when afternoon thunderstorms supplement irrigation.

### How Much Water Per Session?

The SJRWMD recommends applying **1/2 to 3/4 inch of water per irrigation day** for established lawns. Here's how to figure out what that means for your system:

1. **Place several straight-sided containers** (tuna cans work great) around your yard
2. **Run your sprinklers for your normal duration**
3. **Measure the water depth** in each container with a ruler
4. **Adjust run time** until you're hitting 1/2–3/4 inch

Most rotor-head sprinkler systems take 35–50 minutes per zone to deliver 3/4 inch. Pop-up spray heads deliver water faster — usually 15–25 minutes per zone. Your [irrigation system](/articles/irrigation-guide-jacksonville-lawns) output varies by water pressure, head type, and spacing.

### Seasonal Watering Adjustments

Just because you're allowed to water twice a week doesn't mean you always should. Adjust based on the season and rainfall:

- **Summer (June–September):** Use both watering days. Jacksonville averages 6–8 inches of rain per month in summer, so you may be able to skip sessions after heavy thunderstorms.
- **Fall (October–November):** Rainfall drops significantly. Use both days, but watch for overwatering as temperatures cool — this is prime [brown patch season](/articles/brown-patch-fungus-jacksonville-sod).
- **Winter (December–February):** You often only need one watering day per week, or none during rainy stretches. Overwatering in winter is one of the most common mistakes Jacksonville homeowners make.
- **Spring (March–May):** Gradually increase as temperatures rise and the grass exits dormancy. Both days are usually needed by April.

## Smart Irrigation Tips for Jacksonville Homeowners

### Install a Rain Sensor (It's the Law)

Florida law actually requires all automatic irrigation systems to have a functioning **rain sensor** or **soil moisture sensor**. The device shuts off your sprinklers when it detects sufficient rainfall, preventing your system from running during or after a storm.

If your rain sensor is broken or missing, replace it. They cost very little at any Jacksonville hardware store and take 15 minutes to install. Besides being legally required, they prevent waterlogging that leads to fungal disease and root rot.

### Upgrade to a Smart Controller

A Wi-Fi-enabled smart irrigation controller adjusts your watering schedule automatically based on local weather data, soil type, and plant type. These controllers connect to weather stations and skip irrigation when rain is forecast — far more sophisticated than a basic rain sensor.

For Jacksonville homeowners, a smart controller typically reduces water usage by 20–40% compared to a traditional timer — without any negative impact on lawn health. Many JEA and SJRWMD programs have offered rebates for smart controller installations in the past, so check current offerings before you buy.

### Zone Your System Properly

Different areas of your yard need different amounts of water:

- **Full-sun areas** need more water than shaded zones
- **Sandy soil areas** (common in Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach) drain faster and may need longer run times
- **Slopes** need shorter run cycles with repeat intervals to prevent runoff
- **Shaded areas under oaks** need less water — overwatering in shade is a recipe for fungal problems

If your sprinkler system runs every zone for the same duration, you're overwatering some areas and underwatering others. Adjust each zone independently based on its specific conditions.

### Water at the Right Time

The optimal watering window for Jacksonville lawns is **4:00 AM to 8:00 AM**. Here's why:

- **Wind is calmest** at dawn, so sprinkler coverage is most uniform
- **Temperatures are coolest**, minimizing evaporation
- **Grass blades dry quickly** as the sun rises, reducing the window for fungal infection
- **Water pressure is typically highest** in early morning when neighborhood demand is lowest

Avoid evening watering (after 6 PM) whenever possible. Wet grass sitting overnight in Jacksonville's humidity is the primary driver of [lawn fungus](/articles/brown-patch-fungus-jacksonville-sod).

## What Happens If You Violate Watering Restrictions?

The SJRWMD and local authorities take violations seriously, though enforcement tends to follow a progressive approach:

1. **First offense:** Usually a warning notice
2. **Subsequent violations:** Fines that increase with each offense
3. **Persistent violations:** Potential mandatory irrigation system lockout

In practice, most violations in Jacksonville are reported by neighbors or spotted during routine patrols. The most common triggers are sprinklers running midday, watering on non-designated days, or irrigation running during heavy rain (indicating a broken or missing rain sensor).

The easiest way to avoid any issues: set your timer correctly, install a rain sensor, and check your system once a month to make sure it's working as programmed.

## New Sod Installation and Watering Restrictions

If you're having [new sod installed](/services), the 30-day exemption gives you the flexibility to water as needed during the critical establishment period. Here's how to handle it:

1. **Keep your installation invoice** with the date clearly noted
2. **Post a sign** in your yard during the establishment period (some installers provide these) — it signals to neighbors and code enforcement that you're within the exemption
3. **Water according to the [establishment schedule](/articles/new-sod-care-first-30-days-jacksonville)**, not more — the exemption isn't a license to flood your yard
4. **Transition back to the regular schedule** by day 31

At [Jax Sod](/contact), we make sure every customer understands both the establishment watering schedule and when to transition back to the SJRWMD rules. It's part of the post-installation guidance we provide with every job.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I water my lawn three days a week in Jacksonville?

Under normal conditions, no. The SJRWMD restricts residential irrigation to two designated days per week based on your address. The only exception is newly installed sod (30-day exemption), newly seeded areas (90-day exemption), and hand watering with a hose and shut-off nozzle. Reclaimed water customers may have different schedules set by JEA.

### What are my specific watering days?

Odd-numbered addresses water on Wednesday and Saturday. Even-numbered addresses water on Thursday and Sunday. Non-residential properties water on Tuesday and Friday. Watering must occur before 10 AM or after 4 PM.

### Do watering restrictions apply to well water?

Yes. SJRWMD restrictions apply regardless of your water source — JEA municipal water, private well, or reclaimed water. The restrictions are designed to protect the overall water supply, which includes the Floridan Aquifer that most Jacksonville wells draw from.

### How do I know if I'm watering enough on just two days per week?

Check your lawn for signs of drought stress: grass blades folding in half lengthwise, a blue-gray color instead of green, or footprints that remain visible for several minutes after you walk across the lawn. If you see these signs, increase the duration (not frequency) of your watering sessions. You want 1/2 to 3/4 inch of water per session, applied slowly enough to soak in without running off.

### My HOA requires a green lawn — what if the watering schedule isn't enough?

Florida law (Section 373.185, Florida Statutes) prohibits HOAs and local governments from penalizing homeowners who reduce irrigation to comply with water management district restrictions. If your lawn shows drought stress due to following SJRWMD rules, your HOA cannot fine you for it. That said, a well-managed lawn on the two-day schedule should stay green in Jacksonville's climate for most of the year. If you're struggling, the issue is more likely irrigation system problems, soil quality, or grass variety than insufficient watering days.
