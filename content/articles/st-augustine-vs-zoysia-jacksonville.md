When Jacksonville homeowners ask me which grass to install, 90% of the time the choice comes down to St. Augustine or Zoysia. Both thrive here. Both look great. But they have different personalities. Let me help you pick the right one.

## The Quick Comparison

| Factor | St. Augustine | Zoysia |
|---|---|---|
| Sun Needs | 6+ hours (Floratam), 4+ hours (Palmetto) | 6+ hours (tolerates light shade) |
| Drought Tolerance | Moderate | Excellent |
| Traffic Tolerance | Moderate | Excellent |
| Texture | Coarse, wide blades | Fine, dense, carpet-like |
| Cost | $$ (Lower) | $$$ (Higher) |
| Chinch Bug Risk | High (major pest) | Low |

## Choose St. Augustine If...

- **You have shade:** Palmetto St. Augustine is the most shade-tolerant option in Florida. Under oaks? St. Augustine.
- **You want lower cost:** St. Augustine is more affordable per square foot.
- **You like the classic Florida look:** Those wide, lush blades are iconic in Jacksonville neighborhoods.

## Choose Zoysia If...

- **You have kids or dogs:** Zoysia rebounds from traffic like no other grass. It's the playground champion.
- **You want drought resistance:** Zoysia has deep roots and tolerates dry spells better than St. Augustine.
- **You want that "golf course" look:** Zoysia's fine, dense texture is visually stunning.
- **You're tired of chinch bugs:** Zoysia isn't bothered by them.

## My Recommendation After 37 Years

For most Jacksonville homeowners with **full sun and an active family**, I recommend **Empire Zoysia**. It's more expensive upfront, but it's tougher, uses less water, and looks amazing year-round.

If you have **significant shade** (4+ hours of tree cover), go with **Palmetto St. Augustine**. No Zoysia can match Palmetto's shade performance.
