## The Climate Dictates the Grass

Florida's climate is a paradox for lawns. We have abundant sunshine and rainfall, which sounds ideal for growing grass. However, we also have brutal summer heat, sandy soil with almost zero nutrient retention, salt air near the coast, and diseases that thrive in our humidity. Choosing the wrong grass for your specific conditions is the most common (and most expensive) mistake homeowners make.

At Jax Sod, we don't just sell grass. We consult with every customer to match the right variety to their yard's unique conditions: sun exposure, soil type, foot traffic, salt exposure, and watering habits. Here is your guide to the major players.

## St. Augustine: The Florida Standard

St. Augustine is the most popular residential lawn grass in Florida, and for good reason. Its wide, flat blades create a lush, dense carpet that screams "curb appeal." It tolerates heat, moderate shade, and establishes quickly.

### Popular Varieties We Install:

- **Floratam:** The workhorse. Cheapest, fastest growing, and widely available. However, it needs full sun (6+ hours) and is susceptible to chinch bugs. Best for open, sunny yards.
- **Palmetto:** The shade champion. Palmetto tolerates significantly more shade than Floratam (as low as 4-5 hours of sunlight). It also has better cold tolerance for North Florida winters. Our #1 recommendation for most Jacksonville yards.
- **Seville:** A finer-bladed St. Augustine with excellent shade tolerance and a more manicured appearance. A great choice for landscapes where aesthetics are a top priority.
- **CitraBlue:** A newer, premium variety from the University of Florida. It boasts a unique blue-green color, improved disease resistance, and excellent shade tolerance.

### St. Augustine Pros:
- Beautiful, dense appearance
- Good shade tolerance (especially Palmetto/Seville)
- Fast establishment

### St. Augustine Cons:
- Susceptible to chinch bugs (especially Floratam)
- Requires regular watering
- Can develop thatch problems
- Does not tolerate heavy foot traffic as well as Bermuda or Zoysia

## Zoysia: The Premium Choice

Zoysia is increasingly popular in Jacksonville. It has a finer texture than St. Augustine, feels like a carpet underfoot, and has superior drought tolerance and traffic resistance.

### Popular Varieties:

- **Empire:** The most popular Zoysia in Florida. A medium-textured blade with excellent drought tolerance and rapid lateral spread. Great for families with kids and pets.
- **Zeon:** An ultra-fine bladed variety that looks like a putting green. It's the "luxury" choice for homeowners who want the absolute best appearance.

### Zoysia Pros:
- Excellent drought tolerance
- Superior traffic recovery
- Dense growth crowds out weeds
- Fewer pest problems than St. Augustine

### Zoysia Cons:
- Slower to establish than St. Augustine
- More expensive per pallet
- Goes dormant (turns brown) in winter more noticeably than St. Augustine
- Requires sharper mower blades due to tough leaf tissue

## Bermuda: The Sports Turf

If you need a lawn that can take punishment, Bermuda is the answer. Golf courses, football fields, and playgrounds use Bermuda because of its aggressive self-repair and traffic tolerance.

### Best For:
- Full sun yards (needs 8+ hours)
- Active families/heavy foot traffic
- Budget-conscious projects (often the least expensive sod)

### Bermuda Cons:
- Zero shade tolerance
- Invasive: will creep into flower beds
- Goes completely dormant (straw-brown) in winter
- Requires frequent mowing (grows very fast)

## Bahia: The Low-Maintenance Option

Bahia is a tough, deep-rooted grass often seen along highways and in pastures. It's not the "prettiest" lawn, but it's incredibly low maintenance and drought resistant.

### Best For:
- Large acreage or rural properties
- Homeowners who want minimal watering and fertilizing
- Erosion control on slopes

### Bahia Cons:
- Open growth habit (not a dense, carpet-like lawn)
- Tall, unsightly seed heads in summer
- Can look sparse compared to St. Augustine or Zoysia

## How We Help You Choose

During your free estimate, the Jax Sod team evaluates:

1. **Sun/Shade Mapping:** We note which areas get full sun, partial shade, and deep shade throughout the day.
2. **Soil Conditions:** Sandy? Clay? Compacted? This affects drainage and root development.
3. **Usage:** Kids? Dogs? Entertaining? Different grasses handle traffic differently.
4. **Budget:** We offer options at every price point without sacrificing quality.
5. **Aesthetics:** Some customers want a manicured "golf course" look; others want a natural, low-key vibe.

The right grass in the right location is the single biggest factor in long-term lawn success. Let Jax Sod guide your decision.
