# Evergreen Shrubs Jacksonville FL: Year-Round Privacy & Beauty

If you've spent any time in Jacksonville, you know our landscapes don't follow the same rules as the rest of the country. While homeowners up north watch their shrubs go dormant and lose leaves every fall, we get to enjoy lush, green landscapes twelve months a year—if you choose the right plants.

Evergreen shrubs are the backbone of any Jacksonville landscape. They provide year-round privacy, create structure in your yard, and handle our unique Zone 9a/9b climate without constant babysitting. But not every evergreen thrives here, and picking the wrong one can mean dealing with disease, constant pruning, or plants that just look sad come August.

After years of working in Jacksonville landscapes, I've seen which shrubs actually perform and which ones homeowners regret planting. Here's what works.

## Why Evergreen Shrubs Matter in Jacksonville

Our growing season is long—really long. We don't get the hard freezes that force plants into dormancy, which means your landscape is on display all year. Dead or brown plants stick out like a sore thumb in February when everything else is still growing.

Evergreen shrubs give you:

**Privacy that doesn't disappear.** Deciduous shrubs lose their leaves in winter, which means your neighbor's pool deck becomes very visible from November through March. Evergreens hold their foliage year-round.

**Structure in the landscape.** They create bones for your yard—the framework that makes everything else look intentional rather than random.

**Lower maintenance.** Once established, most evergreens suited to Jacksonville don't need constant attention. They're adapted to our heat, humidity, and summer thunderstorms.

The key is matching the plant to the site. Jacksonville spans two USDA hardiness zones (9a and 9b), and microclimates vary across the region. What thrives in Riverside might struggle in Ponte Vedra, and vice versa.

## Best Evergreen Shrubs for Jacksonville Privacy Hedges

### Wax Myrtle (Myrica cerifera)

This is my go-to recommendation for homeowners who want a fast-growing privacy screen without the maintenance headaches. Wax myrtle is a Florida native that grows 10-15 feet tall and handles everything Jacksonville throws at it.

It tolerates wet soil, dry soil, sandy soil, and even salt spray if you're near the coast. Deer generally leave it alone. The fragrant foliage repels mosquitoes, which is a bonus when you're trying to enjoy your backyard in summer.

Plant them 4-5 feet apart for a hedge. They'll fill in within two growing seasons. You can prune them into a formal hedge or let them grow naturally for a more casual screen.

### Cleyera (Ternstroemia gymnanthera)

If you want a refined, formal look, cleyera delivers. It grows slowly to about 8-10 feet with glossy, dark green leaves that develop bronze tints on new growth.

Cleyera handles partial shade better than most evergreens, making it ideal for areas under tree canopies or on the north side of structures. It's dense enough for privacy but doesn't require aggressive pruning to keep it in bounds.

Space them 3-4 feet apart for a tight hedge. They're more drought-sensitive than wax myrtle, so consistent irrigation during establishment is important.

### Podocarpus (Podocarpus macrophyllus)

Podocarpus has been a staple in Jacksonville landscapes for decades, and for good reason. It's versatile enough to use as a hedge, screen, or specimen plant, and it tolerates our summer heat without scorching.

The upright varieties (like 'Maki') work well for narrow spaces where you need vertical screening. Standard podocarpus can reach 15-20 feet but responds well to pruning and can be maintained at any height.

Plant them 3-5 feet apart depending on how quickly you want a solid screen. They prefer well-drained soil and will sulk in areas that stay wet.

## Foundation Plantings That Actually Work

Foundation plantings are where I see the most mistakes. Homeowners plant shrubs that outgrow the space within a few years, leading to constant pruning battles or plants that block windows and overwhelm the house.

### Dwarf Yaupon Holly (Ilex vomitoria 'Nana')

This is one of the toughest small evergreens you can plant in Jacksonville. Dwarf yaupon grows slowly to about 3-4 feet tall and wide, making it perfect for foundation beds.

It handles full sun, partial shade, drought, wet soil, and neglect. The small, dark green leaves create a fine texture that contrasts nicely with coarser plants. It's also one of the few shrubs that doesn't need regular pruning to maintain its shape.

### Indian Hawthorn (Rhaphiolepis indica)

Indian hawthorn is a workhorse for Jacksonville landscapes. It stays compact (most varieties max out at 3-4 feet), blooms in spring with pink or white flowers, and requires minimal care once established.

It prefers full sun but tolerates light shade. Well-drained soil is important—these will struggle in low spots that stay wet. Varieties like 'Eleanor Tabor' and 'Snow White' perform consistently here.

### Loropetalum (Loropetalum chinense)

If you want color, loropetalum delivers. The purple-leaf varieties provide year-round burgundy foliage and produce fringed pink flowers in spring and sporadically through fall.

Dwarf varieties like 'Purple Pixie' stay under 2 feet, making them suitable for low foundation plantings or borders. Larger varieties can reach 6-8 feet and work as accent plants or informal hedges.

They need consistent moisture during establishment and prefer slightly acidic soil. Mulch helps moderate soil temperature and retain moisture during our hot summers.

## Dealing with Jacksonville's Unique Growing Conditions

### Heat and Humidity

Our summers are brutal. High temperatures combined with afternoon thunderstorms create perfect conditions for fungal diseases. Choosing disease-resistant varieties and ensuring good air circulation around plants prevents most problems.

Avoid planting shrubs too close together. Even if spacing recommendations say 3 feet, consider going to 4 feet if the area doesn't get good airflow.

### Soil Challenges

Jacksonville soil ranges from pure sand near the beaches to heavy clay in some inland areas. Most evergreen shrubs prefer well-drained soil, which means amending clay soils with compost or choosing plants that tolerate wet feet.

For sandy soils, adding organic matter improves water retention and provides nutrients. A 2-3 inch layer of mulch helps regulate soil temperature and reduces water loss.

### Salt Tolerance

If you're within a few miles of the coast, salt tolerance matters. Wax myrtle, yaupon holly, and certain viburnum varieties handle salt spray better than others. Podocarpus and azaleas struggle in salty conditions.

## Shrubs to Avoid in Jacksonville

Not every evergreen sold at local nurseries is a good fit for Jacksonville. Here are some that consistently underperform:

**Boxwood (Buxus species)** - Struggles with our summer heat and humidity. Prone to boxwood blight and requires more maintenance than alternatives.

**English Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus)** - Gets too large for most residential landscapes and suffers in extreme heat. Better options exist.

**Burning Bush (Euonymus alatus)** - Deciduous, not evergreen, despite what some people think. Also invasive in some areas.

**Blue Pacific Juniper** - Marketed for year-round color but often develops brown patches in Jacksonville's humid summers.

## Planting and Establishment Tips

The best time to plant evergreen shrubs in Jacksonville is fall (October through November) or late winter (February through early March). This gives roots time to establish before summer heat arrives.

Dig planting holes 2-3 times wider than the root ball but no deeper. The top of the root ball should sit level with or slightly above the surrounding soil. Planting too deep is one of the most common mistakes and leads to root rot.

Water deeply at planting and maintain consistent moisture for the first growing season. Once established, most evergreens suited to Jacksonville are fairly drought-tolerant, but they'll look better with irrigation during extended dry periods.

Apply a 2-3 inch layer of mulch around plants, keeping it pulled back from the stems. Pine bark or pine straw works well and doesn't tie up nitrogen like fresh wood chips can.

## Maintenance Realities

Evergreen shrubs marketed as "low maintenance" still need some attention. Here's what to expect:

**Pruning** - Most evergreens need shaping once or twice a year. Late winter (before new growth) and mid-summer are good times. Avoid heavy pruning in fall, which can stimulate tender growth that's vulnerable to winter cold snaps.

**Fertilization** - A slow-release fertilizer in early spring supports healthy growth. Avoid pushing too much nitrogen, which creates excessive soft growth prone to pests and diseases.

**Irrigation** - Even drought-tolerant shrubs need water during establishment. Supplemental irrigation during dry spells keeps plants looking their best.

**Pest monitoring** - Scale, aphids, and spider mites occasionally show up. Catching problems early makes them easier to manage.

## Creating Layered Plantings

The best landscapes use evergreen shrubs in layers, combining different heights and textures. A typical arrangement might include:

- Tall screening shrubs (wax myrtle, podocarpus) along property lines
- Medium shrubs (loropetalum, cleyera) in mid-ground areas
- Low foundation plants (dwarf yaupon, Indian hawthorn) near structures
- Groundcovers (asiatic jasmine, liriope) to fill gaps and reduce mulch

This creates depth and visual interest while serving functional purposes like privacy and defining spaces.

## The Bottom Line

Choosing evergreen shrubs for Jacksonville comes down to matching plants to site conditions and being realistic about maintenance. The shrubs I've covered here are proven performers in Zone 9a/9b that handle our climate without constant intervention.

Start with the basics—assess your light conditions, soil type, and how much space you have. Then choose plants that fit those parameters rather than trying to force something to work that's not suited to the site.

Your landscape should make your life easier, not create constant work. The right evergreen shrubs do exactly that while keeping your property looking good every month of the year.
