# Lawn Renovation vs New Sod: Which Does Your Jacksonville Yard Need?

Your Jacksonville lawn is looking rough. Maybe the summer heat and chinch bugs left bare patches across your Southside yard. Maybe years of neglect have turned your Mandarin St. Augustine into more weeds than grass. The question every Northeast Florida homeowner eventually faces: should you renovate what's there, or start fresh with new sod?

At Jax Sod, we've helped homeowners across Jacksonville, Clay County, and St. Johns County make this decision for over 37 years. The answer isn't always obvious, and the wrong choice can waste thousands of dollars and months of effort.

This guide will help you honestly assess your lawn's condition, understand the realistic costs and timelines for both approaches, and make the decision that's right for your Jacksonville property. Let's break down when lawn renovation vs new sod Jacksonville makes the most sense.

## When Lawn Renovation Works

Lawn renovation means improving your existing turf without removing it. You're working with what you have, bringing it back to health through cultural practices like aeration, dethatching, fertilization, and strategic overseeding or plugging.

Renovation works best when your lawn has a solid foundation. If more than 50% of your yard is still covered with healthy grass, renovation is worth considering. The key word here is "healthy"—grass that's the correct variety for Jacksonville's climate and your yard's conditions, just stressed or thinned out.

Renovation also makes sense when you have isolated problem areas rather than widespread failure. Maybe one section gets too much shade from your live oak, or there's a low spot that stays wet after Florida's afternoon thunderstorms. These localized issues don't require replacing the entire lawn.

The right grass type matters enormously. If you already have appropriate grass for Northeast Florida—St. Augustine varieties like Floratam or Palmetto, or Bermuda cultivars like TifTuf or Celebration—then renovation can restore them. But if someone planted the wrong grass for Jacksonville's Zone 9a/9b climate, renovation is just polishing a problem.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** St. Augustine Floratam planted in full shade will never thrive no matter how much you renovate. Some problems require starting over with the right grass type.

We've successfully renovated lawns across Ponte Vedra, Jacksonville Beach, and Nocatee where homeowners simply needed better care practices. Good bones, bad maintenance—that's the ideal renovation candidate.

## When New Sod Is Necessary

Some lawns are beyond renovation. When less than 50% of your yard is covered with viable grass, you're fighting a losing battle. At that point, the cost and effort of renovation often exceeds just starting fresh with quality sod.

New sod becomes necessary when you have the wrong grass type for your conditions. We see this frequently in Jacksonville—someone planted Bahia (a pasture grass) in a high-visibility front yard, or they have old-variety St. Augustine that's susceptible to chinch bugs and gray leaf spot. Wrong grass, wrong place, wrong climate—renovation won't fix genetic problems.

Severe pest or disease damage often requires starting over. If your entire Baymeadows yard was decimated by chinch bugs or fungal disease has rotted the root system, there's nothing healthy left to renovate. You need fresh, disease-free sod from a reputable source.

Major grading issues demand new sod installation. If your Arlington yard has significant drainage problems, low spots that pool water, or severe erosion, you'll need to regrade the soil. Once you've moved that much earth, your existing grass is destroyed anyway—might as well start with premium sod on properly prepared ground.

We installed new sod throughout San Marco, Riverside, and Avondale properties where historic homes had compacted clay soil and decades-old grass varieties. Sometimes renovation isn't enough; transformation requires replacement.

## The Renovation Process for Jacksonville Lawns

If renovation makes sense for your Northeast Florida property, here's what the process actually involves. This isn't a weekend project—proper renovation takes time and multiple steps.

### Core Aeration

Aerating Jacksonville's sandy-clay soil alleviates compaction and improves root growth. We pull plugs of soil out, creating channels for water, oxygen, and nutrients to reach grass roots. This is especially important if you've had heavy foot traffic or equipment on your Deerwood or Fleming Island lawn.

Time this for early spring (March-April) for St. Augustine or late spring (May-June) for Bermuda when grass is actively growing and can recover quickly.

### Dethatching

Thatch is the layer of dead grass stems and roots between the soil and green grass blades. A thin layer is beneficial, but more than half an inch prevents water and fertilizer from reaching roots. Northeast Florida's heat and humidity can create excessive thatch in St. Augustine lawns.

Power raking or dethatching removes this buildup. You'll have an ugly lawn for about two weeks while it recovers, but the improvement in water infiltration and fertilizer efficiency is worth it.

### Topdressing

Adding a thin layer of quality topsoil or compost smooths minor surface irregularities and improves soil structure. For Jacksonville's sandy soils, organic matter helps retain moisture during summer heat. Apply quarter-inch to half-inch layer and work it into the grass canopy with the back of a rake.

This step makes a noticeable difference in Orange Park and Fruit Cove properties where sandy soil dries out quickly.

### Fertilization

Feed your lawn with appropriate fertilizer for Jacksonville conditions. We recommend slow-release nitrogen fertilizers with micronutrients including iron (for that deep green color) and manganese (prevents yellowing in alkaline soils).

Spring and fall applications work best. Avoid summer fertilization during Jacksonville's rainy season—excess nitrogen with heavy rain causes rapid growth that's weak and disease-prone.

### Spot Treatment

Address specific problem areas. If you have bare patches smaller than three feet across, you can spot-sod those areas. For larger sections, plugging St. Augustine (placing sod pieces 6-12 inches apart) or overseeding Bermuda (spreading seed over prepared soil) fills in gaps without replacing everything.

### Realistic Timeline

Lawn renovation isn't instant. Expect 3-6 months before your Middleburg or Yulee lawn looks consistently good. Aeration and dethatching show improvement within weeks, but filling in bare spots and achieving thick, uniform coverage takes a full growing season.

## The Re-Sod Process for Jacksonville Properties

Complete lawn replacement follows a different path. You're starting from scratch, which means more upfront work but faster results.

### Kill Existing Vegetation

First, eliminate everything growing there. Non-selective herbicide (glyphosate-based products) kills grass, weeds, and anything else green. Apply it, wait 7-10 days for complete die-off, then proceed. This prevents old grass or weeds from competing with your new sod.

Some Jacksonville homeowners skip this step, thinking they can just lay sod over existing grass. Don't. You'll have poor root establishment and weed problems for years.

### Remove Old Grass

After killing vegetation, you have options. Sod cutters slice beneath the root zone, removing the top layer of dead grass and roots. For small Jacksonville Beach yards, this is manageable. For larger Nocatee properties, consider a skid steer with cutting attachment.

The alternative is tilling dead grass into the soil, but this works only if your existing lawn was healthy—you don't want to till disease or weed seeds throughout your soil.

### Soil Preparation

Now you have bare ground. Test your soil pH—Northeast Florida typically runs 5.5-6.5, which is fine for St. Augustine and Bermuda. Add lime if pH is below 5.5, sulfur if above 7.0 (rare here but possible in areas with construction debris).

Add organic matter if your soil is extremely sandy. Spread 1-2 inches of quality compost and till it into the top 6 inches. This improves water retention without creating the drainage problems that pure clay would cause.

### Grading

Proper grading makes or breaks your new lawn. You want gentle slopes away from buildings (minimum 2% grade) and no low spots that pool water. Jacksonville's afternoon thunderstorms produce heavy rain quickly—poor drainage kills sod.

Use a landscape rake to smooth the soil. Fill low spots, level high spots, create gentle contours. The final grade should be smooth enough that you could run a reel mower over it without scalping high points.

### Sod Installation

Finally, the easy part—at least relatively speaking. Quality sod from Jax Sod arrives fresh-cut and should be installed within 24 hours. Lay it in a brick-like pattern with tight seams, stagger the joints, and ensure good soil contact.

Roll the new sod to eliminate air pockets and establish root-to-soil contact. Water immediately and keep it consistently moist (not soggy) for the first two weeks while roots establish.

## Cost Comparison: Renovation vs Re-Sod in Jacksonville

Money matters. Let's talk realistic costs for an average Northeast Florida yard—we'll use 5,000 square feet as our baseline.

### Lawn Renovation Costs

**DIY Renovation:**
- Core aeration rental: $75-100 per day
- Dethatching rental: $75-100 per day
- Topsoil/compost (2 cubic yards): $80-150
- Fertilizer: $50-100
- Spot sod (200 sq ft): $70-170
- Plugs or seed: $100-200
- **Total DIY: $450-$820**

**Professional Renovation:**
- Core aeration: $200-350
- Dethatching: $200-350
- Topdressing: $300-500
- Fertilization: $75-125
- Spot sodding: $200-400
- **Total Professional: $975-$1,725**

Most Jacksonville homeowners spend $500-$1,500 for renovation depending on how much they DIY versus hire out.

### Complete Re-Sod Costs

**DIY Re-Sod:**
- Herbicide: $50-75
- Sod cutter rental: $100-150 per day
- Soil amendments: $100-200
- Sod delivery (5,000 sq ft at $0.35-$0.50 per sq ft): $1,750-$2,500
- **Total DIY: $2,000-$2,925**

**Professional Re-Sod:**
- Site preparation (kill, remove, grade): $1,000-$2,000

Most Jacksonville homeowners spend $2,000-$6,000 for complete re-sod depending on property size, existing conditions, and whether they hire professionals.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Professional installation includes warranty on materials and labor. DIY saves money but you absorb all risk if something goes wrong.

## Timeline Comparison

Time is money, and your time has value. How long until you have a great-looking lawn?

**Renovation Timeline:**
- Initial work: 1-2 days (aeration, dethatching, topdressing)
- First visible improvement: 2-4 weeks
- Filling in bare spots: 8-12 weeks
- Full recovery and thick coverage: 3-6 months
- **Total time to great lawn: 3-6 months**

**Re-Sod Timeline:**
- Site prep (kill, wait, remove): 10-14 days
- Grading and soil prep: 1-2 days
- Sod installation: 1 day for average yard
- Root establishment: 2-3 weeks
- Full use of lawn: 3-4 weeks
- **Total time to great lawn: 5-7 weeks**

New sod delivers a beautiful lawn in about a month. Renovation takes 3-6 months. For Ponte Vedra homeowners preparing to sell, or Fleming Island families who want to enjoy their yard this season, time matters.

## The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

Here's what we often recommend at Jax Sod: combine both strategies. Re-sod the worst areas, renovate the rest.

Maybe your front yard in Avondale is 80% gone but your backyard is 60% healthy. Replace the front entirely, renovate the back. You get the curb appeal of new sod where it counts most, and you save money by improving rather than replacing areas that still have potential.

This hybrid approach works particularly well for large Mandarin or St. Johns County properties where complete re-sod would cost $10,000-$15,000. Target the high-visibility and most-damaged areas for replacement, renovate secondary spaces and side yards.

We've done this successfully across Jacksonville—new Palmetto St. Augustine in the front, renovation with plugging and fertilization in the back, and the results look cohesive within a few months.

## How to Honestly Assess Your Jacksonville Lawn

Let's create a decision framework. Walk your property and assess these factors:

**Grass Coverage:**
- More than 70% coverage with desired grass type: Lean toward renovation
- 50-70% coverage with desired grass type: Could go either way
- Less than 50% coverage: Lean toward new sod

**Grass Type:**
- Appropriate variety for your conditions (sun/shade, soil, use): Renovation viable
- Wrong variety for Northeast Florida climate: New sod required

**Problem Distribution:**
- Isolated problem areas: Renovation with spot treatment
- Widespread issues across entire lawn: New sod likely better

**Underlying Issues:**
- Good drainage, proper grading, healthy soil: Renovation can work
- Poor drainage, grading problems, compacted soil: Re-sod with proper prep

**Budget Reality:**
- Limited budget, willing to wait: Renovation
- Budget available, want fast results: New sod

**Time Expectations:**
- Can wait 3-6 months for gradual improvement: Renovation
- Need great lawn in 4-6 weeks: New sod

Most Jacksonville homeowners know their lawn's condition once they honestly assess these factors. If you're still unsure, we offer free consultations at Jax Sod—we'll walk your property and give you an honest recommendation.

## Common Mistakes Jacksonville Homeowners Make

After 37 years serving Northeast Florida, we've seen every lawn mistake possible. Here are the most common errors in the lawn renovation vs new sod decision:

**Mistake 1: Renovating the Wrong Grass Type**

No amount of aeration and fertilization will make Bahia grass suitable for a high-end San Marco front yard. If the grass type is wrong for your vision and use, replace it.

**Mistake 2: Not Addressing Underlying Problems**

Laying new sod over poorly-drained soil just gives you expensive dead sod in a few months. Fix drainage, grading, and soil issues before choosing either renovation or re-sod.

**Mistake 3: Underestimating Renovation Time**

Homeowners see lawn care TV shows where renovation happens in a weekend. Reality in Jacksonville: renovation takes months. If you need results for a specific event or deadline, sod is your answer.

**Mistake 4: Cheaping Out on Sod Quality**

When you do decide on new sod, don't buy the cheapest available. Poor-quality sod from unverified sources may carry diseases, weed seeds, or be harvested too thin to establish well. Quality sod from reputable Northeast Florida growers like Jax Sod costs a bit more upfront but establishes faster and lasts longer.

**Mistake 5: DIY Beyond Your Skill Level**

Some homeowners tackle projects beyond their equipment and experience. Grading a yard properly requires laser levels and experience—get it wrong and you'll have drainage problems forever. Know when to hire professionals.

## Making Your Decision

The lawn renovation vs new sod Jacksonville question comes down to your lawn's current condition, your budget, your timeline, and your expectations.

Renovation makes sense when you have decent existing grass that needs help—more than 50% coverage with appropriate varieties, good underlying soil conditions, and you're willing to wait several months for improvement. You'll spend $500-$1,500 and have results in 3-6 months.

New sod makes sense when your lawn is beyond saving—less than 50% coverage, wrong grass types, severe pest or disease damage, or major grading issues that require soil work anyway. You'll spend $2,000-$6,000 but have a beautiful lawn in 4-6 weeks.

For many Jacksonville homeowners, a hybrid approach offers the best balance—replace the worst areas, renovate the rest, and achieve great results without breaking the bank.
