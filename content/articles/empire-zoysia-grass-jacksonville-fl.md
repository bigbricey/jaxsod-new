# Empire Zoysia Grass: Complete Jacksonville Guide

Empire Zoysia has been gaining significant traction among Jacksonville homeowners who want a premium lawn experience without the high maintenance demands of St. Augustine grass. This fine-textured, dark green turfgrass offers an attractive middle ground between the coarse utility of Bahia and the lush but input-intensive character of St. Augustine varieties. But does Empire Zoysia deliver on its promises in Northeast Florida's unique climate and soil conditions?

At Jax Sod, we've installed Empire Zoysia on hundreds of Jacksonville-area properties over the past 37 years, watching the variety's performance across diverse neighborhoods from Ponte Vedra's coastal homes to inland properties in Clay County. We've seen where Empire excels and where it disappoints, which yard conditions suit it perfectly, and which situations call for different grass varieties.

This comprehensive guide covers everything Jacksonville homeowners need to know about Empire Zoysia, including its distinctive characteristics, how it handles our hot summers and mild winters, shade and drought tolerance, the realistic timeline for establishment, year-round maintenance requirements, cost comparisons, and specific recommendations for which properties and neighborhoods benefit most from this premium grass variety.

## What Is Empire Zoysia?

Empire Zoysia is a warm-season turfgrass variety developed in Brazil and introduced to the United States in the 1990s. The grass quickly gained popularity throughout the southeastern United States, including Florida, for its combination of attractive appearance, good shade tolerance, and moderate maintenance requirements.

Zoysia grass species (Zoysia japonica, Zoysia matrella, and hybrids) originated in Asia and were introduced to the U.S. in the early 1900s. Empire represents a Zoysia japonica selection that balances cold hardiness, acceptable establishment speed, and good overall performance in transition-zone and southern climates.

Unlike St. Augustine grass, which spreads primarily through above-ground stolons, Empire Zoysia spreads through both stolons and rhizomes (underground stems). This dual spreading mechanism creates an extremely dense turf that resists weed invasion effectively once established. The rhizomatous growth also contributes to Empire's excellent wear tolerance and recovery from damage.

Empire produces a fine-textured, carpet-like lawn with narrow leaf blades substantially thinner than St. Augustine varieties. The texture feels soft underfoot and creates an upscale, manicured appearance that appeals to homeowners in Jacksonville's more prestigious neighborhoods.

## Why Empire Zoysia Is Gaining Popularity in Jacksonville

Several trends have driven increased Empire Zoysia adoption throughout Northeast Florida in recent years. Understanding these factors helps explain why this grass variety deserves serious consideration from Jacksonville homeowners planning new installations or lawn replacements.

### Premium Appearance

Empire delivers the fine texture and dark green color that homeowners associate with high-end lawns. The grass creates visual impact that exceeds St. Augustine varieties and dramatically surpasses Bahia in aesthetic appeal. For properties where curb appeal and landscape appearance drive decision-making, Empire provides a noticeably premium result.

### Lower Water Requirements Than St. Augustine

Jacksonville homeowners increasingly prioritize water conservation due to rising utility costs, environmental concerns, and periodic watering restrictions from the St. Johns River Water Management District. Empire's superior drought tolerance compared to St. Augustine reduces irrigation requirements and provides more flexibility during dry periods or water restrictions.

### Reduced Mowing Frequency

Empire's slower vertical growth compared to St. Augustine means less frequent mowing during peak season. Homeowners save time and money on lawn maintenance while still achieving attractive results. This benefit particularly appeals to busy professionals and families who want beautiful lawns without constant care.

### Excellent Wear Tolerance for Active Families

Properties with children, dogs, or frequent outdoor activities benefit from Empire's exceptional ability to withstand and recover from foot traffic and play. The dense, rhizomatous growth fills in damaged areas quickly and maintains coverage under use that would thin or destroy other grass varieties.

### Shift Toward Lower-Input Landscaping

Florida-Friendly Landscaping principles and broader environmental awareness have increased interest in grass varieties requiring fewer inputs—less water, less fertilizer, fewer pesticides—while still delivering acceptable appearance. Empire fits this profile better than most St. Augustine varieties.

### Positive Word-of-Mouth

As more Jacksonville homeowners install Empire and experience its benefits firsthand, positive recommendations spread through neighborhoods and social networks. This organic adoption accelerates as the grass moves beyond early adopters toward mainstream acceptance.

## Characteristics of Empire Zoysia

Empire displays distinctive traits that set it apart from other turfgrasses commonly used in Jacksonville.

### Fine Texture and Dense Growth

Empire produces narrow leaf blades approximately 2-3mm wide—substantially finer than St. Augustine's 4-10mm blades. This fine texture creates a refined, carpet-like appearance similar to Bermuda grass but with better shade tolerance and less aggressive growth.

The combination of stolon and rhizome growth creates extremely dense turf, often described as the densest common warm-season turfgrass. Once fully established, this density effectively crowds out weeds and creates a uniform, luxurious appearance.

### Dark Green Color

Empire maintains rich, dark green color throughout the active growing season without requiring excessive fertilization. The natural color depth exceeds most St. Augustine varieties and approaches that of premium varieties like CitraBlue. Proper fertilization and irrigation keep Empire looking vibrant from April through October.

### Moderate Growth Rate

Empire grows more slowly than St. Augustine varieties, both vertically and laterally. The slower vertical growth reduces mowing frequency—a practical benefit for time-conscious homeowners. However, the slower lateral spread means longer establishment periods from sod installation to fully mature lawn.

### Cold Tolerance and Winter Dormancy

As a Zoysia japonica variety, Empire displays excellent cold tolerance for a warm-season grass. The variety tolerates temperatures well below what would kill St. Augustine, making it suitable for use considerably farther north than Florida.

In Jacksonville's USDA Zone 9a and 9b climate, Empire's cold tolerance provides substantial margin. However, the grass does go dormant during winter, turning brown or tan when soil temperatures drop below 55°F. This dormancy represents one of Empire's most significant considerations for Jacksonville homeowners accustomed to St. Augustine varieties that maintain better winter color.

### Fine Root System

Empire develops a dense, fine root system that penetrates deeply into soil compared to St. Augustine. This root development contributes to the grass's drought tolerance and allows it to extract nutrients efficiently from Jacksonville's sandy soils.

## Shade Tolerance: Good But With Limitations

Shade tolerance often determines whether specific grass varieties succeed or fail on Jacksonville properties with mature tree canopy. Empire offers good shade tolerance—better than Bermuda grass but not quite matching the shade performance of Palmetto or CitraBlue St. Augustine.

Empire maintains acceptable density and appearance with 4-5 hours of direct sunlight or 6-7 hours of filtered light daily. This makes it suitable for many partial-shade situations common in established Jacksonville neighborhoods like Mandarin, San Marco, Riverside, and Avondale, particularly in side yards or under high tree canopy.

However, Empire struggles in deep shade receiving less than 4 hours of sun. Areas under dense oak canopy, north-facing yards with limited direct sun, or locations shaded by structures may thin or fail with Empire. For these challenging conditions, shade-tolerant St. Augustine varieties typically perform better.

The shade tolerance equation changes seasonally. During Jacksonville's longer summer days (14+ hours of daylight in June), yards receive more total sun hours. Winter's shorter days (10 hours in December) reduce light availability. Areas that adequately support Empire during summer may prove marginal during winter, contributing to seasonal thin spots in borderline locations.

At Jax Sod, we carefully evaluate sun exposure before recommending Empire for shaded properties. We look for consistent 4-5 hours minimum sun exposure year-round, not just during summer's peak. Properties with less light typically receive recommendations for Palmetto or CitraBlue St. Augustine instead.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** The type of shade matters as much as duration. High, dappled shade from tall pines allows more useful light to reach grass than dense, low shade from mature oaks. Consider canopy characteristics when evaluating your property's shade conditions.

## Drought Tolerance for Jacksonville's Variable Rainfall

Empire Zoysia's excellent drought tolerance represents one of its most valuable characteristics for Jacksonville homeowners. The variety handles extended dry periods substantially better than St. Augustine, rivaling or exceeding Bahia's drought performance while delivering far superior appearance.

The extensive, deep root system allows Empire to access soil moisture unavailable to shallow-rooted grasses. Even during Jacksonville's occasional spring and fall dry spells, established Empire maintains acceptable color and coverage with minimal supplemental irrigation. The grass typically shows drought stress symptoms 7-10 days later than St. Augustine varieties when watering is withheld.

When drought stress does occur, Empire responds by folding its leaf blades and taking on a bluish-gray tint. At this point, applying 0.5-0.75 inches of water triggers recovery within 24-48 hours. If water remains unavailable, Empire enters drought dormancy—turning brown but remaining alive through its extensive rhizome system. The grass greens up quickly once moisture returns.

This drought tolerance translates into practical benefits:

**Reduced irrigation requirements:** Established Empire lawns may need 25-40% less supplemental irrigation than St. Augustine during dry periods, reducing water usage and utility costs.

**Greater flexibility during watering restrictions:** When the St. Johns River Water Management District implements drought restrictions limiting irrigation days, Empire's extended tolerance between watering provides crucial flexibility.

**Lower maintenance during dry spells:** The stress of constant irrigation decisions and lawn monitoring decreases when your grass variety tolerates extended periods without water.

**Better appearance with less input:** Empire maintains better color and density than St. Augustine during moderate drought stress, requiring less water to achieve acceptable appearance.

For coastal properties near Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Ponte Vedra, Empire's drought tolerance combines beneficially with its good salt tolerance to create a resilient turf suited to challenging coastal conditions.

## Salt Tolerance for Coastal Northeast Florida Properties

Salt tolerance matters significantly for Jacksonville-area properties near the coast, particularly those in Ponte Vedra, Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and beachfront locations along Duval and Nassau County coastlines. Salt spray from ocean breezes, elevated soil salinity, and occasional storm surge create challenging conditions that damage or kill salt-sensitive turfgrasses.

Empire Zoysia displays good salt tolerance—not the exceptional resistance of certain specialized varieties but substantially better than most St. Augustine cultivars. The grass tolerates moderate salt exposure from ocean spray and performs acceptably in mildly saline soils common in coastal areas.

Properties within 0.5-1 mile of the ocean benefit from Empire's salt resistance. The variety maintains better appearance and coverage under chronic low-level salt stress than varieties like Floratam or even Palmetto St. Augustine. Coastal homeowners often report better long-term performance from Empire than from previous St. Augustine lawns that gradually declined under salt pressure.

However, Empire won't survive direct exposure to seawater flooding or severe storm surge. No common turfgrass tolerates actual inundation with saltwater. Properties in flood-prone coastal zones need emergency plans for grass recovery after hurricane events regardless of variety.

Salt tolerance combines synergistically with Empire's drought resistance for coastal properties. Both stressors—salt and drought—often occur together in coastal environments. A grass variety that handles both creates more resilient lawns requiring less intervention during Jacksonville's variable coastal conditions.

## Mowing Empire Zoysia: Height and Frequency

Proper mowing critically affects Empire Zoysia's appearance and health. The variety requires different management than St. Augustine grass, and homeowners accustomed to St. Augustine's 3.5-4.5 inch height must adjust their practices.

### Optimal Mowing Height

Empire performs best when maintained at 1-2 inches—substantially lower than St. Augustine's 3.5-4.5 inch range. This lower height showcases Empire's fine texture and creates the carpet-like appearance the grass is known for. Mowing higher than 2 inches allows the grass to become slightly leggy and lose its characteristic density.

Most homeowners maintain Empire at 1.5 inches, splitting the difference between the ultra-low 1-inch putting-green look and the upper 2-inch limit. This height provides good appearance while maintaining reasonable stress tolerance during Jacksonville's hot summers.

### Mowing Frequency

Empire's slower vertical growth rate means less frequent mowing than St. Augustine during peak season. From May through September, expect to mow Empire every 7-10 days compared to St. Augustine's 4-7 day intervals. This reduced frequency saves time and money over the course of a season.

During spring and fall shoulder seasons, Empire may require mowing only every 10-14 days. Winter dormancy eliminates or minimizes mowing requirements from December through February, though occasional mowing removes accumulated leaves and debris.

### Equipment Considerations

Empire's dense growth and lower mowing height require sharp mower blades and adequate mower power. Dull blades tear rather than cut the fine leaf blades, creating a frayed, brown appearance. Sharpen or replace mower blades at the beginning of each season and mid-summer.

Rotary mowers work adequately for Empire when properly maintained, though reel mowers create superior cuts at the low heights Empire prefers. Homeowners seeking the finest appearance might consider reel mowers, particularly for smaller lawns where manual reel mowers are practical.

### The One-Third Rule

As with all turfgrasses, never remove more than one-third of the blade height in a single mowing. If Empire grows to 3 inches, cut it back to 2 inches rather than scalping it to 1.5 inches. Scalping stresses grass, damages the growing point, and creates thin spots vulnerable to weed invasion.

## Slow Establishment Period: Set Realistic Expectations

Empire Zoysia's establishment period represents one of its most challenging characteristics for Jacksonville homeowners accustomed to St. Augustine's quick rooting. Understanding this limitation and setting realistic expectations prevents disappointment during the critical first season after installation.

### Initial Rooting Timeline

Empire sod requires 3-4 weeks to develop adequate root attachment under optimal conditions—approximately one week longer than St. Augustine. During this period, the sod remains vulnerable to displacement, requires consistent moisture, and can't tolerate foot traffic.

Successful establishment demands daily watering for the first 2-3 weeks, gradually reducing frequency during weeks 3-4 as roots penetrate into underlying soil. Jacksonville's hot summers can complicate establishment by increasing water demand and heat stress on newly installed sod.

### Full Establishment and Maturity

Beyond initial rooting, Empire requires 12-18 months to achieve full density and maturity. During this extended period, the grass gradually fills in gaps between sod pieces, develops its characteristic dense growth, and establishes the deep root system that provides its drought tolerance.

Year-one Empire lawns won't display the variety's full potential. Homeowners should expect gradual improvement over the first two growing seasons before the lawn reaches mature appearance and performance. This extended timeline contrasts with St. Augustine, which often looks nearly mature within 4-6 months of installation.

### Why Establishment Takes Longer

Empire's slower lateral growth directly causes its extended establishment period. While St. Augustine aggressively spreads through stolons to quickly fill bare spots and connect sod pieces, Empire's more measured growth takes additional time to achieve the same coverage.

The rhizomatous growth that creates Empire's density also slows establishment because rhizomes develop underground and take longer to generate visible surface coverage compared to above-ground stolons.

### Establishment Success Factors

Several factors influence establishment success and timeline:

**Installation timing:** Spring and early fall provide optimal conditions for Empire establishment in Jacksonville. Avoid installation during Jacksonville's hottest months (July-August) or approaching winter dormancy (November-December).

**Soil preparation:** Adequate topsoil depth and proper grading accelerate establishment. Empire performs best with at least 3-4 inches of quality topsoil over Jacksonville's typical sand base.

**Consistent irrigation:** Empire establishment absolutely requires consistent moisture during the first month. Missed watering sessions during this critical period can set back or damage developing roots.

**Limited traffic:** Keeping people and pets off newly installed Empire until roots firmly anchor is essential. Premature traffic displaces sod and damages developing roots.

At Jax Sod, we carefully counsel homeowners about Empire's establishment timeline before installation. Understanding the extended period required for full maturity prevents disappointment and helps homeowners maintain proper care during the critical first season.

## Winter Dormancy Behavior in Jacksonville's Mild Climate

Empire Zoysia's winter dormancy represents its most visually striking characteristic and the feature most likely to surprise Jacksonville homeowners accustomed to St. Augustine varieties that maintain reasonable green color year-round.

### When Dormancy Occurs

Empire begins losing green color when soil temperatures consistently drop below 55°F, typically occurring in Jacksonville from late November through early December. The grass transitions from dark green to lighter green, then yellowish-green, and finally to brown or tan as dormancy deepens.

Dormancy period lasts from December through February in most Jacksonville locations. Coastal areas and southern parts of Duval and St. Johns counties may see shorter dormancy, while inland Clay and Nassau County properties experience longer dormant periods.

### What Dormancy Means

Dormancy is not death. The grass remains alive but suspends active growth, directing energy into root and rhizome survival rather than producing green leaf blades. This natural response protects the plant from cold damage and conserves resources until favorable growing conditions return.

The brown appearance during dormancy strikes many homeowners as unattractive, particularly neighbors with St. Augustine lawns maintaining pale green winter color. However, dormancy actually benefits Empire by reducing winter maintenance requirements and protecting the grass from potential cold damage.

### Spring Green-Up

Empire breaks dormancy and resumes active growth when soil temperatures consistently exceed 65°F, typically from late March through mid-April in Jacksonville. Green-up occurs gradually over 2-3 weeks as new leaf blades emerge from the stolons and rhizomes.

Full color and density return by May, just as Jacksonville's growing season begins in earnest. From May through October, Empire displays its characteristic dark green color and fine texture without the winter brown that concerns some homeowners.

### Managing Dormancy Concerns

Homeowners bothered by Empire's winter brown color have several options:

**Overseeding with ryegrass:** Some homeowners overseed Empire with perennial or annual ryegrass in October to maintain winter green color. The ryegrass germinates quickly, provides green coverage through winter, and dies out naturally as Empire greens up in spring. This adds cost and maintenance but solves the appearance issue.

**Accepting natural dormancy:** Many homeowners simply accept Empire's winter appearance as natural and temporary. The trade-off of 3-4 months of brown lawn for 8-9 months of premium appearance seems reasonable to those prioritizing summer aesthetics and performance.

**Strategic landscape design:** Focusing winter interest on evergreen shrubs, hardscapes, and non-lawn landscape elements shifts visual emphasis away from dormant grass. This design approach works particularly well for Jacksonville properties.

**Rear yard vs front yard placement:** Installing Empire in back yards where winter appearance matters less, while using St. Augustine in highly visible front yards, balances each variety's strengths.

### Comparison to St. Augustine Winter Color

St. Augustine varieties don't truly maintain summer color through Jacksonville winters. They transition to paler green or yellowish-green and may show cold damage browning after hard freezes. However, this muted green generally appears more attractive than Empire's brown dormancy to most homeowners.

The decision partly depends on personal preference and yard use patterns. Homeowners who rarely use outdoor spaces during winter may not mind dormant brown lawns. Families who entertain outdoors year-round or prioritize year-round curb appeal often prefer St. Augustine's winter appearance despite Empire's summer advantages.

## Year-Round Maintenance Calendar for Jacksonville

Proper Empire Zoysia care varies by season. This maintenance calendar optimizes Empire's performance through Jacksonville's distinct seasonal patterns.

### Spring (March-May)

**Early Spring:** Empire breaks dormancy. Avoid heavy traffic on emerging grass. Begin mowing when grass reaches 2-3 inches, cutting back to 1.5 inches. Remove any winter debris.

**Fertilization:** Apply first fertilization of the season in mid-April after grass fully greens up. Use 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet with a complete fertilizer (16-4-8 or similar 4-1-2 ratio).

**Irrigation:** Spring rainfall often provides adequate moisture. Supplement only during dry spells. Established Empire needs minimal spring irrigation.

**Pest Control:** Monitor for emerging insect activity. Apply pre-emergent herbicide in late March or early April to prevent summer weeds.

**Mowing:** Begin regular mowing schedule as growth accelerates. Mow every 7-10 days by late spring.

### Summer (June-August)

**Peak Growing Season:** Empire displays maximum growth and best color during summer. Focus on maintaining appearance through proper mowing and irrigation.

**Fertilization:** Apply 0.5-1.0 pounds nitrogen per 1,000 square feet in mid-June. Avoid late-summer fertilization (after August 15) that stimulates tender growth approaching fall.

**Irrigation:** Summer's frequent afternoon thunderstorms often provide adequate moisture. Supplement during dry periods with 0.75-1.0 inches weekly. Early morning watering (4-8 AM) prevents disease.

**Mowing:** Peak mowing frequency. Expect to mow every 7-10 days. Maintain 1.5-2 inch height.

**Pest Control:** Monitor for chinch bugs, particularly during hot, dry periods. Inspect regularly for signs of insect damage.

**Disease Management:** Proper irrigation timing and avoiding excess nitrogen prevent most disease problems. Empire shows good general disease resistance.

### Fall (September-November)

**Transition Period:** Growth slows as temperatures moderate. Adjust maintenance accordingly.

**Fertilization:** Apply final fertilization in early September with 1 pound nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. This feeds the grass before dormancy and supports root development.

**Irrigation:** Fall often brings dry weather in Jacksonville. Monitor soil moisture and supplement as needed. Reduce irrigation as temperatures cool and dormancy approaches.

**Mowing:** Gradually extend mowing intervals as growth slows. By late November, mowing may cease as dormancy begins.

**Preparation for Dormancy:** Apply pre-emergent herbicide in late October to prevent winter weeds in dormant turf.

### Winter (December-February)

**Dormancy Period:** Empire requires minimal maintenance during dormancy.

**No Fertilization:** Never fertilize dormant grass.

**Minimal Irrigation:** Dormant grass needs little water. Natural rainfall usually provides adequate moisture. Excessive winter irrigation can create disease problems.

**No Mowing:** Unless removing fallen leaves or debris, mowing is unnecessary.

**Traffic Management:** Minimize foot traffic on dormant grass to prevent physical damage and soil compaction.

**Planning:** Use winter months to plan spring projects, schedule soil testing, and prepare for spring maintenance resumption.

## Cost Comparison: Empire vs St. Augustine

Empire Zoysia represents a premium turfgrass option with pricing reflecting its specialized characteristics and market position.

### Material Costs

Empire sod typically costs $0.50-$0.80 per square foot in the Jacksonville area, depending on quantity, season, and supplier. This premium pricing significantly exceeds Floratam ($0.35-$0.50) and approximates or exceeds Palmetto and CitraBlue ($0.45-$0.65).

For a 5,000 square foot Jacksonville lawn:
- **Floratam:** $1,750-$2,500
- **Palmetto/CitraBlue:** $2,250-$3,250
- **Empire Zoysia:** $2,500-$4,000

The premium for Empire amounts to $750-$1,500 over Floratam and $250-$750 over Palmetto on a typical residential lawn. For larger properties common in Clay County and St. Johns County, the difference scales proportionally.

### Installation Costs

Labor costs for Empire installation match other sod varieties. Soil preparation, grading, and installation techniques don't vary significantly by grass type. The material cost differential represents the primary price difference.

### Long-Term Maintenance Costs

Empire's lower maintenance requirements potentially offset some of the upfront premium:

**Reduced mowing:** 6-10 fewer mowing sessions annually translates to $75-$150 savings if using professional service, or time savings for DIY maintenance.

**Lower irrigation costs:** 25-40% reduced water usage during growing season may save $100-$200 annually in irrigation costs depending on lawn size and local water rates.

**Reduced fertilizer:** Empire requires 3-4 pounds of nitrogen annually vs 4-6 pounds for St. Augustine, saving $20-$50 annually on fertilizer costs.

**Similar pest control:** Empire and St. Augustine have comparable pest pressure, requiring similar pest management expenses.

Over a 5-10 year period, Empire's maintenance savings may recoup $1,000-$2,500 of the initial premium. However, the upfront cost difference remains substantial enough to matter for budget-conscious homeowners.

## Best Jacksonville Neighborhoods and Situations for Empire Zoysia

**Homeowners with limited maintenance time:** Busy professionals who want attractive lawns without constant care.

### Situations Where Empire Excels

- Transitioning from high-maintenance St. Augustine to lower-input grass
- Replacing failed St. Augustine in partial-shade locations
- Coastal renovations where salt damaged previous grass
- New construction on quality homes warranting premium landscaping
- Properties with irrigation limitations or water-conservation goals
- Yards with children or dogs requiring durable, traffic-tolerant turf
- Homeowners willing to accept winter dormancy for summer premium appearance

### When to Choose Alternatives

Empire may not suit these situations:

**Heavy shade:** Less than 4 hours sun requires shade-tolerant St. Augustine instead
**Year-round green appearance required:** St. Augustine maintains better winter color
**Large properties with budget constraints:** Empire's premium cost becomes prohibitive on acreage
**Chinch bug-prone neighborhoods:** Floratam's resistance may prove more valuable than Empire's features
**Homeowners wanting quick results:** Empire's slow establishment disappoints those expecting rapid maturity
**Deep shade under dense canopy:** Palmetto or CitraBlue St. Augustine perform better

## Conclusion

Empire Zoysia offers Jacksonville homeowners a genuinely premium turfgrass option that delivers fine texture, dark color, excellent drought tolerance, good shade performance, and reduced maintenance requirements compared to St. Augustine varieties. For properties and homeowners aligned with Empire's characteristics, it provides years of beautiful, relatively low-maintenance lawn coverage that justifies the premium price.

The variety's combination of aesthetic appeal and practical benefits—particularly reduced water usage and mowing frequency—makes it increasingly attractive as homeowners prioritize environmental responsibility and time management alongside lawn appearance.
