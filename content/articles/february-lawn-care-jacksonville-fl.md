# February Lawn Care Jacksonville FL: Getting Your Yard Ready for Spring

February in Jacksonville is that weird in-between month where you're not quite done with winter, but spring is knocking on the door. I've been taking care of lawns from Riverside to Ponte Vedra for years, and this month is crucial for setting up your yard for success. The weather's starting to warm up, the azaleas at the Cummer Museum are getting ready to pop, and your lawn is waking up from its winter nap.

Let me walk you through exactly what you need to do this month to get ahead of the game.

## Understanding February Weather in Jacksonville

Here's the thing about February in Northeast Florida—the temperature swings are real. One day you're wearing shorts at the beach, the next you might see a frost warning. We're sitting in Zone 9a and 9b, which means our lawns never fully go dormant like they do up north, but they do slow down considerably.

Average temperatures this month bounce between the mid-40s at night and the mid-60s during the day. That's actually perfect for getting some pre-spring work done without stressing out your grass. The soil temperature is still cool, usually hovering around 55-60°F, which matters more than you'd think.

## Mowing: Hold Your Horses (Mostly)

If you've got St. Augustine—which most of us do from Mandarin to Atlantic Beach—it's probably not growing much yet. You might need to mow once or twice this month, but don't go crazy. Keep your mower blade set high, around 3.5 to 4 inches. 

For those of you in Nocatee or Julington Creek with Zoysia, same deal. Resist the urge to scalp it down. I know it's tempting to get that clean look, but cutting too low in February exposes the crown of the grass to potential late-season frost, and our sandy soil doesn't retain heat well enough to protect it.

Bahia grass folks in Westside or Brentwood—you're barely touching the mower this month. Maybe once if we get a really warm stretch.

### Blade Maintenance Matters

This is a great time to sharpen your mower blades or take them to a shop. A dull blade tears the grass instead of cutting it clean, which opens up wounds that fungi love to exploit. Trust me, brown patch doesn't care what month it is if conditions are right.

## Fertilization: Patience is Key

Here's where a lot of people mess up. They see the first warm weekend, run to Home Depot, grab a bag of fertilizer, and throw it down. Don't do it.

Your grass isn't actively growing yet. If you fertilize now, you're basically feeding the weeds—and we've got plenty of those ready to party. Dollarweed, chamberbitter, and Florida betony are all waiting for free nutrients.

Wait until mid-to-late March when soil temperatures consistently hit 65°F and your grass is actively greening up. There's no award for being the first person to fertilize in your neighborhood.

The one exception? If you did a soil test last fall (smart move) and it showed you need lime to adjust pH, February is actually a good time to apply it. Our sandy soils tend to be acidic, and lime takes time to work. Just make sure you're not guessing—get that soil test done first.

## Weed Control: Your February Priority

This is the month to get aggressive with pre-emergent herbicide. See, summer annuals like crabgrass are about to germinate when soil temps hit 65-70°F, which happens in March. But pre-emergent works by creating a barrier in the soil that stops seeds from germinating.

The key is getting it down BEFORE the weeds start. Think of it like this: you wouldn't install a security system after you've been robbed, right? Same logic.

For residential lawns in San Marco, Riverside, or Murray Hill, look for products with prodiamine or dithiopyr. Follow the label rates exactly—more is not better, and you can actually harm your grass by over-applying.

### Post-Emergent for Existing Weeds

Already got weeds? You'll need a post-emergent. For broadleaf weeds like dollarweed (super common in our area, especially in Ortega and Avondale where the old oaks keep things shady), look for products with three-way combinations of 2,4-D, dicamba, and mecoprop.

Spot-treat rather than blanket-spray if you can. It's better for your grass, your wallet, and the St. Johns River watershed.

## Irrigation: Don't Overdo It

February is usually pretty moist in Jacksonville. We typically get 3-4 inches of rain this month, which is enough for a dormant or semi-dormant lawn.

I see this all the time driving through Deerwood or Baymeadows—sprinklers running when the grass doesn't need it. Overwatering in cool weather is an invitation for fungal diseases. Brown patch absolutely thrives in wet, cool conditions.

Your lawn needs maybe a half-inch of water per week this month, max. That includes rainfall. Most weeks, you won't need to run your irrigation at all.

If we hit a dry spell (it happens), water deeply once a week rather than light daily waterings. Deep watering encourages roots to grow down into our sandy soil, which will pay off big time when June rolls around with 95-degree heat.

## Dealing with Fungal Issues

Speaking of fungi—February is prime time for brown patch and take-all root rot in St. Augustine. The cool, damp conditions are perfect for these diseases.

Brown patch shows up as circular brown areas with a darker "smoke ring" around the edge. Take-all root rot looks similar but the roots will be black and rotted if you pull up a patch.

Prevention is way easier than cure:
- Don't water in the evening (morning watering lets grass dry during the day)
- Improve air circulation by trimming low branches on trees
- Avoid high nitrogen fertilizer (which we're not using this month anyway)

If you spot fungus, consider a fungicide application, but honestly, improving cultural practices usually solves the problem.

## Lawn Equipment Check-Up

You've got time this month before spring hits hard. Use it.

**Mower maintenance:**
- Change the oil
- Replace the air filter
- Sharpen or replace blades
- Check tire pressure
- Fresh gas (old gas from last summer is garbage)

**Trimmer and edger:**
- New spark plug
- Fresh string/line
- Clean air filter
- Lubricate shaft

**Irrigation system:**
- Walk the system and look for broken heads
- Adjust sprinkler directions
- Check for leaks
- Test your rain sensor (most people's don't work)

I can't tell you how many people call me in April saying their stuff broke and they need emergency help. Beat the rush.

## Dealing with Jacksonville's Sandy Soil

Our soil is basically beach sand with delusions of grandeur. It drains fast, which is great for preventing waterlogging, but terrible for holding nutrients and moisture.

February is a good time to address this:

**Top-dressing with compost:** A thin layer (quarter-inch) of quality compost over your lawn adds organic matter that helps with water and nutrient retention. Spread it thin and work it in with a rake or drag mat.

**Core aeration:** If your lawn gets heavy foot traffic (looking at you, folks with kids and dogs), core aeration relieves compaction even in sandy soil. This is especially helpful in common areas around Southside and Arlington where the soil gets packed down.

## Preparing Beds and Landscape Areas

While you're thinking about the lawn, don't forget the landscape beds. February is perfect for:

- Refreshing mulch (keeps weeds down and moderates soil temperature)
- Pruning azaleas AFTER they bloom (usually late February/early March here)
- Cutting back ornamental grasses
- Dividing perennials before they start active growth

A well-maintained landscape makes your lawn look even better.

## Wildlife Considerations

We're lucky to live in a place with great biodiversity. In February, you might notice:

- Sandhill cranes pairing up (they nest in March/April)
- Early migratory birds passing through
- Moles becoming active as soil warms

If moles are tearing up your lawn in Nocatee or World Golf Village, it's because they're following grubs. Control the grubs and you control the moles. But honestly, moles also eat a ton of other pests, so maybe give them some grace.

## Watch the Extended Forecast

Here's a Jacksonville-specific tip: keep an eye on potential late-season cold snaps. Most years, we're fine, but every few years we get a hard freeze in late February or early March that can damage tender new growth.

If a freeze is coming:
- Don't fertilize or stimulate growth
- Water the day before (moist soil holds heat better)
- Cover sensitive plants if needed
- Skip the mow right before cold weather

## Getting Professional Help

Some of you will handle all this yourselves—that's great. But if you're overwhelmed, or you've got a large property in Ponte Vedra Beach or Queen's Harbour, bringing in a professional for a February evaluation makes sense.

A good lawn care company will:
- Assess your grass type and condition
- Check for pest or disease issues
- Create a customized plan for YOUR yard
- Handle the technical stuff like calibrated applications

Just don't wait until March when everyone's calling.

## February Checklist for Jacksonville Lawns

Let me make this simple. Here's your action list:

**Must do:**
- Apply pre-emergent herbicide
- Mow only if needed, keep blade high
- Check and fix irrigation issues
- Spot-treat existing weeds
- Service lawn equipment

**Should do:**
- Sharpen mower blades
- Test soil pH if you haven't recently
- Top-dress with compost in thin layers
- Clean up landscape beds

**Don't do:**
- Fertilize with nitrogen
- Scalp the lawn
- Overwater
- Ignore fungal disease signs

## Looking Ahead

If you do February right, March becomes way easier. You'll have pre-emergent down before weeds germinate, your equipment will be ready to go, and you'll have a clean slate.

Remember, successful lawn care in Jacksonville is about working with our unique conditions—sandy soil, humid climate, and grass varieties that thrive in Zone 9. Fight against nature and you'll lose every time. Work with it and your lawn will reward you.

The best lawns in Riverside, San Marco, and Avondale didn't get that way by accident. They're the result of consistent, timely care that starts right now in February.

Get out there this weekend, walk your yard, make your plan, and execute. Spring is coming faster than you think, and the prep work you do now will show up in your results all season long.
