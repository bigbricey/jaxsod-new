# How Much Does Sod Cost Per Pallet in Jacksonville?

If you're planning a lawn renovation or new sod installation in Jacksonville, one of the first questions you'll ask is: "How much does sod cost per pallet?" It's a straightforward question, but the answer involves several factors that can significantly impact your total project cost. At Jax Sod, we've been serving Northeast Florida for over 37 years, and we've helped thousands of homeowners navigate sod pricing to make informed decisions about their lawn investments.

Understanding sod costs per pallet is essential for budgeting your project accurately. Whether you're renovating your entire lawn in Nocatee, fixing bare spots in Mandarin, or installing fresh grass at a new build in St. Johns County, knowing the price breakdown helps you plan and compare options effectively. The good news is that sod installation remains one of the most cost-effective ways to achieve a beautiful, instant lawn in Jacksonville's challenging climate.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down current 2026 sod pricing in Jacksonville by grass type, explain what factors affect costs, and provide real-world project estimates so you can budget confidently. We'll also share tips on getting the best value for your investment and how to avoid common pricing pitfalls.

## Current 2026 Sod Pricing in Jacksonville

Sod prices in Jacksonville vary by grass type, variety, and supplier. Here's what you can expect to pay per pallet in 2026:

**St. Augustine Grass:** $180-$300 per pallet
St. Augustine remains the most popular choice for Jacksonville lawns, and pricing varies by cultivar. Standard Floratam typically runs $180-$220 per pallet, while premium varieties like Palmetto, CitraBlue, and Seville range from $220-$300 per pallet. The higher-end varieties offer better shade tolerance, drought resistance, and finer texture, which justifies the premium.

**Bermuda Grass:** $150-$250 per pallet
Bermuda grass is an excellent choice for full-sun areas and high-traffic lawns. Common Bermuda starts around $150-$180 per pallet, while improved hybrids like TifTuf, Celebration, and Latitude 36 range from $200-$250 per pallet. TifTuf has become increasingly popular in Northeast Florida due to its exceptional drought tolerance.

**Zoysia Grass:** $200-$350 per pallet
Zoysia is a premium grass option that offers excellent wear tolerance and a beautiful, dense texture. Empire Zoysia typically costs $200-$250 per pallet, while high-end varieties like Zeon and Icon can reach $300-$350 per pallet. The higher cost reflects slower growth rates at sod farms and superior performance characteristics.

**Bahia Grass:** $120-$200 per pallet
Bahia is the budget-friendly option for Jacksonville homeowners, particularly popular in Clay County and rural areas. Argentine Bahia runs $120-$150 per pallet, while improved Pensacola Bahia costs $150-$200 per pallet. While less aesthetically refined than other options, Bahia is incredibly tough and low-maintenance.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Prices fluctuate seasonally, with peak demand in spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) sometimes driving costs up by 10-15%. If your schedule is flexible, consider installing during summer or winter for potential savings.

## Understanding Pallet Coverage

Before calculating your total project cost, it's important to understand how much area one pallet of sod covers. In Jacksonville, a standard pallet of sod typically covers **400-500 square feet**. The exact coverage depends on several factors:

Most pallets contain 450 square feet of sod when first cut at the farm. However, we recommend calculating based on 400 square feet of usable coverage to account for:

- Trimming around curved beds and borders
- Waste from irregular yard shapes
- Damaged or torn pieces (usually minimal with fresh, quality sod)
- Overlap at seams to ensure no gaps

For example, if you need to sod 2,000 square feet of lawn in Ponte Vedra, you'll need approximately 5 pallets (2,000 ÷ 400 = 5). Always round up to the nearest full pallet—running short mid-installation is frustrating and can delay your project by days.

## What Affects Sod Price Per Pallet in Jacksonville

Several factors influence how much you'll pay for sod in the Jacksonville area:

### Grass Type and Variety

As shown in our pricing breakdown, grass type is the primary cost driver. Premium cultivars developed through years of research and testing command higher prices. For instance, Palmetto St. Augustine costs more than Floratam because it offers better shade tolerance and requires less maintenance, which many Jacksonville homeowners find worth the investment.

### Time of Year

Sod pricing follows seasonal demand patterns. Spring (March through May) and fall (September through November) are peak installation seasons in Northeast Florida when temperatures are ideal and rainfall is moderate. During these periods, demand surges and prices may increase by 10-20%. Summer installations (June-August) are less popular due to heat stress and intensive watering requirements, while winter (December-February) sees reduced demand as grass goes dormant, potentially leading to lower prices.

### Quantity Ordered

Like most products, sod pricing often improves with volume. A single pallet for a small repair might cost more per pallet than ordering 10+ pallets for a full lawn renovation. At Jax Sod, we offer competitive pricing for larger projects throughout Duval County and surrounding areas. If you're working with neighbors on simultaneous projects, combining orders can sometimes reduce per-pallet costs.

### Delivery Distance

Delivery fees depend on how far you are from the sod farm. We're located in Green Cove Springs and serve all of Northeast Florida, but delivery to downtown Jacksonville neighborhoods like San Marco or Riverside typically costs less than delivery to outlying areas like Yulee or western Clay County. Expect delivery fees ranging from $50-$150 depending on distance and order size.

### Sod Freshness and Quality

Fresh-cut sod should be delivered and installed within 24 hours of harvest for optimal results. Budget suppliers sometimes offer discounted sod that's been sitting longer, but this is a false economy—older sod establishes poorly and may die, requiring complete replacement. At Jax Sod, we cut to order, ensuring you receive the freshest possible product.

## Installation Costs on Top of Sod Price

The per-pallet cost of sod is only part of your total project budget. Professional installation adds significant value and typically costs **$0.50-$1.50 per square foot** in Jacksonville, depending on project complexity.

Basic installation includes site preparation, sod laying, and initial watering. This typically runs $0.50-$0.75 per square foot for straightforward projects with level ground and easy access.

More complex installations requiring extensive site prep cost $1.00-$1.50 per square foot. This includes:

- Removing existing grass or vegetation
- Grading and leveling the yard
- Adding topsoil or soil amendments (Jacksonville's sandy soil often needs enrichment)
- Installing edging or borders
- Navigating difficult access (e.g., backyards without side gates)

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Our sandy Florida soil often needs 2-4 inches of quality topsoil added before sod installation to provide adequate nutrients and moisture retention. This typically adds $0.30-$0.60 per square foot to your project but dramatically improves long-term sod health.

## Total Project Cost Examples for Jacksonville Yards

Let's look at realistic total project costs for typical Jacksonville properties:

### Small Yard Renovation (1,000 sq ft)

- Sod needed: 2.5 pallets
- St. Augustine (Floratam) at $200/pallet: $500
- Delivery: $75
- Basic installation at $0.60/sq ft: $600
- **Total: $1,175**

### Average Jacksonville Lawn (2,500 sq ft)

- Sod needed: 6.25 pallets (round up to 7)
- Palmetto St. Augustine at $250/pallet: $1,750
- Delivery: $100
- Standard installation with minimal prep at $0.70/sq ft: $1,750
- **Total: $3,600**

### Large Suburban Yard (5,000 sq ft)

- Sod needed: 12.5 pallets (round up to 13)
- TifTuf Bermuda at $225/pallet: $2,925
- Delivery: $125
- Installation with soil prep at $0.90/sq ft: $4,500
- **Total: $7,550**

### Premium Installation with Site Work (3,000 sq ft)

- Sod needed: 7.5 pallets (round up to 8)
- CitraBlue St. Augustine at $275/pallet: $2,200
- Delivery: $100
- Removal of old lawn: $300
- 3 inches topsoil addition: $1,200
- Installation at $0.80/sq ft: $2,400
- **Total: $6,200**

These examples reflect typical projects we complete throughout Jacksonville, Ponte Vedra, Orange Park, and surrounding communities. Your specific costs will vary based on grass selection, site conditions, and current pricing.

## Price Comparison: Sod Farms vs Retailers vs Full-Service Installers

Where you purchase sod significantly impacts your total cost. Here's how different suppliers compare:

**Sod Farms (like Jax Sod):** Buying directly from a sod farm offers the best combination of price, quality, and freshness. You pay wholesale or near-wholesale prices and get sod cut specifically for your project. Delivery is usually available, and many farms offer installation services. This is the most cost-effective option for quality sod.

**Retail Garden Centers:** Home improvement stores and garden centers sell sod at retail prices, typically 30-50% higher than farm-direct pricing. The convenience factor is the main advantage—you can pick up a few pieces for small repairs. However, sod quality can be inconsistent, and inventory sits longer, reducing freshness.

**Full-Service Landscaping Companies:** These companies handle everything from design to installation but mark up sod costs significantly. You might pay $1.50-$2.50 per square foot all-inclusive, which is convenient but expensive. This option makes sense for complex landscaping projects but is overkill for straightforward sod installation.

**Online Marketplaces:** Some companies now facilitate sod delivery through online platforms. Pricing varies widely, and quality control can be inconsistent. You're often dealing with middlemen, which adds cost without adding value.

For most Jacksonville homeowners, buying directly from a reputable sod farm like Jax Sod provides the best value—quality product, fair pricing, expert advice, and professional installation options.

## Seasonal Pricing Fluctuations in Jacksonville

Understanding seasonal pricing patterns helps you time your purchase strategically:

**Spring (March-May):** Peak season. Demand surges as temperatures warm and homeowners want their lawns looking great for summer. Prices reach annual highs, sometimes 15-20% above winter baseline. Sod farms run near capacity, and installation crews are booked weeks in advance. If you're planning spring installation, order early—ideally in late February.

**Summer (June-August):** Moderate demand. The intense Jacksonville heat and afternoon thunderstorms make installation challenging. Established sod requires intensive watering to survive heat stress. However, grass grows vigorously, and sod establishes quickly if properly maintained. Prices moderate to near baseline, and installation scheduling is more flexible.

**Fall (September-November):** Peak season. Ideal installation conditions—warm soil, cooler air, reduced rainfall compared to summer. Demand rivals spring levels, and prices increase accordingly. Fall-installed sod establishes beautifully before winter dormancy. Book early for fall installation.

**Winter (December-February):** Off-season. Grass grows slowly or goes dormant, reducing sod farm production. Demand drops significantly. This is the best time for price-conscious buyers—sod farms offer discounts to move inventory, sometimes 10-15% below peak-season pricing. The tradeoff is slower establishment, but winter-installed sod greens up beautifully when spring arrives.

At Jax Sod, we maintain consistent quality year-round and work with customers to schedule installations when conditions are optimal for success, regardless of season.

## How to Get the Best Value on Sod in Jacksonville

Smart shopping strategies can save hundreds or even thousands on your sod project:

**Get Multiple Quotes:** Compare pricing from at least three suppliers. Make sure you're comparing equivalent products—Floratam St. Augustine from one farm should be priced similarly to another. Beware of prices that seem too good to be true; they usually indicate lower quality or older sod.

**Consider Grass Type Carefully:** Don't automatically choose the cheapest option. A $180 pallet of Bahia might seem attractive compared to $250 Palmetto St. Augustine, but Bahia's coarser texture and different maintenance needs might not suit your expectations. Choose grass based on your needs, not just price.

**Time Your Purchase:** If your schedule is flexible, winter installation can save 10-15% compared to peak-season pricing. The sod establishes more slowly but ultimately performs just as well.

**Bundle Services:** Many sod farms, including Jax Sod, offer package pricing for sod, delivery, and installation. Bundling services often costs less than purchasing each component separately.

**Prepare Your Site:** If you're handy and have time, handling site preparation yourself (removing old grass, grading, adding topsoil) can save $0.30-$0.50 per square foot. Just ensure you do it correctly—poor preparation leads to poor results.

**Buy Direct:** Eliminate middlemen by purchasing directly from sod farms. You'll pay less and receive fresher product.

**Don't Skimp on Quality:** Fresh, quality sod from a reputable farm costs more initially but establishes faster, requires less water, and outlasts cheaper alternatives. This is not an area to cut corners.

## Common Pricing Pitfalls to Avoid

Watch out for these issues when shopping for sod in Jacksonville:

**Comparing Only Per-Pallet Price:** A farm offering $150 pallets might seem cheaper than one charging $200, but if their pallets cover only 350 square feet versus 450 square feet, you're actually paying more per square foot. Always calculate cost per square foot for accurate comparisons.

**Ignoring Installation Complexity:** A quote for "$0.50 per square foot installation" sounds great until you realize it doesn't include removing your existing lawn, adding necessary topsoil, or dealing with your sloped yard. Make sure quotes include all necessary work.

**Choosing Grass Based Solely on Price:** We see homeowners in Deerwood and Town Center choose Bahia because it's cheapest, then regret the decision when they see how it looks compared to their neighbors' St. Augustine lawns. Choose grass that meets your needs and expectations.

**Not Accounting for Delivery and Installation:** That $180 pallet becomes $250+ when you add delivery and installation. Budget for the complete project, not just sod cost.

**Buying Old Sod:** Some suppliers discount sod that's been sitting for days. This sod looks fine on the pallet but struggles to establish and may die. Only buy fresh-cut sod, even if it costs slightly more.

## Conclusion

Understanding sod cost per pallet in Jacksonville helps you budget accurately and make informed decisions about your lawn investment. In 2026, expect to pay $180-$300 per pallet for St. Augustine, $150-$250 for Bermuda, $200-$350 for Zoysia, and $120-$200 for Bahia grass, with each pallet covering approximately 400-500 square feet.

Remember that per-pallet cost is just one component of your total project expense.
