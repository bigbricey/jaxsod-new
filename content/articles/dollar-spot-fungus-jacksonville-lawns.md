# Dollar Spot Fungus in Jacksonville Lawns: Identification and Treatment

You walk outside one spring morning to find your previously healthy Bermuda or Zoysia lawn dotted with dozens of small, tan-colored spots about the size of silver dollars. By the next week, these spots have multiplied and begun merging into larger irregular dead areas. Welcome to dollar spot, one of the most visually distinctive lawn diseases affecting Jacksonville homeowners.

Dollar spot gets its name from the characteristic circular lesions it creates—typically 2-6 inches in diameter, roughly the size of a silver dollar coin. While it's not the most devastating disease Jacksonville lawns face (that distinction goes to gray leaf spot on St. Augustine), dollar spot can quickly turn an attractive lawn into a spotted, declining mess that takes months to recover.

At Jax Sod, we've treated dollar spot on countless Bermuda and Zoysia lawns throughout Duval, Clay, St. Johns, and Nassau Counties over our 37+ years in business. We've learned that dollar spot is unique among lawn diseases because it often indicates a nutrition problem rather than just environmental conditions. In many cases, proper fertilization resolves dollar spot without any fungicide application—something that can't be said for most other fungal diseases.

This guide will help you identify dollar spot with confidence, understand what causes it in Jacksonville's specific climate, explain treatment options from simple fertilization to fungicide applications, and provide prevention strategies that keep dollar spot from becoming an annual problem.

## What Dollar Spot Looks Like

Accurate identification is the critical first step in any disease treatment. Dollar spot has distinctive characteristics that, once you know what to look for, make it fairly easy to distinguish from other lawn diseases.

**Early Symptoms**

Dollar spot begins as small, circular spots of discolored grass, initially appearing water-soaked or dark. Within 2-3 days, these spots turn tan to straw-colored as the grass dies. The spots are remarkably consistent in size—typically 2-3 inches in diameter in early infection, expanding to 4-6 inches as disease progresses.

If you examine individual grass blades within affected spots, you'll see distinctive hourglass-shaped lesions. These lesions are tan in the center with reddish-brown to purplish-brown borders. The hourglass shape, with the lesion narrowing in the middle of the blade, is a key identifying feature of dollar spot.

**Advanced Symptoms**

As disease progresses, individual spots may merge, creating irregular dead patches larger than the original dollar-sized spots. However, the margins of merged areas still show the small, circular patterns that distinguish dollar spot from diseases like brown patch, which create larger circles from the beginning.

In severe infestations, hundreds of small spots can appear across the lawn, giving it a pockmarked appearance. Grass within the spots is completely dead and straw-colored, while surrounding grass remains green and healthy.

**Morning Diagnostic Signs**

One of dollar spot's most distinctive features appears only during early morning hours when dew is present. Walk your lawn at sunrise, and you'll see white, cottony fungal mycelium growing over affected spots. This fluffy white growth looks like thin cobwebs or cotton candy stretched across the grass. By mid-morning, as dew evaporates and temperatures rise, this mycelium disappears until the next morning.

Seeing this white mycelium on tan spots is nearly diagnostic for dollar spot. Most other common Jacksonville lawn diseases don't produce visible mycelium, or produce it in different colors (brown patch sometimes shows dark mycelium, for example).

**Comparison to Similar Diseases**

Dollar spot is sometimes confused with other diseases, but key differences help distinguish it:

- **Brown patch** creates much larger circles (1-3 feet or more in diameter) with a distinctive "smoke ring" border, while dollar spot creates small circles without smoke rings
- **Gray leaf spot** affects primarily St. Augustine grass and causes overall thinning rather than distinct spots, while dollar spot affects Bermuda and Zoysia with distinct circular patterns
- **Fairy ring** creates dark green rings, often with mushrooms, while dollar spot creates dead tan spots
- **Drought stress** creates irregular brown areas that follow traffic patterns or slope aspects, while dollar spot creates uniform circular spots distributed throughout the lawn

## Grasses Affected in Jacksonville

Understanding which grass types develop dollar spot helps you assess risk for your specific lawn and adjust management practices accordingly.

**Bermuda Grass: Primary Target**

Bermuda grass is dollar spot's favorite host in Jacksonville. All Bermuda varieties can develop dollar spot, but common Bermuda (the seeded variety) is significantly more susceptible than improved cultivars. Among improved varieties, TifTuf Bermuda shows excellent dollar spot resistance, Celebration Bermuda shows moderate resistance, and Tifway 419 and Bimini show moderate to high susceptibility.

Bermuda lawns in Jacksonville typically encounter dollar spot during spring (April-May) and fall (September-October) transition periods. Summer usually brings too much heat and humidity for dollar spot, while winter dormancy eliminates risk entirely.

If you have a Bermuda lawn in neighborhoods like Deerwood, Baymeadows, or Jacksonville Beach where Bermuda is popular for its drought tolerance and traffic resistance, you should watch carefully for dollar spot during April-May and September-October.

**Zoysia Grass: Secondary Target**

Zoysia grass is moderately susceptible to dollar spot, generally less so than Bermuda but more than St. Augustine. Empire Zoysia, the most common variety in Jacksonville, shows moderate susceptibility. Zeon Zoysia and Icon Zoysia show better resistance but can still develop dollar spot under favorable disease conditions.

Zoysia's slower growth rate compared to Bermuda means dollar spot damage is more visible and takes longer to recover. A Zoysia lawn with dollar spot may show symptoms for 6-8 weeks even after treatment, while Bermuda often recovers within 3-4 weeks.

**St. Augustine and Bahia: Rarely Affected**

St. Augustine grass, the most popular choice in Jacksonville from San Marco to Nocatee, very rarely develops dollar spot. If you have St. Augustine and see spot-like symptoms, you're almost certainly looking at a different disease (likely brown patch or gray leaf spot) or insect damage (chinch bugs create similar-sized spots).

Bahia grass also shows good resistance to dollar spot, though it can occasionally develop the disease under severe conditions. If you're choosing grass types partially based on disease resistance, Bahia's low-maintenance nature includes minimal dollar spot risk.

**Golf Courses and Athletic Fields**

Dollar spot is particularly problematic on Jacksonville-area golf courses and sports fields, where low mowing heights (under 1 inch) are common. Shorter mowing stresses grass and provides ideal conditions for dollar spot development. If you maintain Bermuda or Zoysia at golf course heights (under 1.5 inches), expect elevated dollar spot risk requiring more intensive management.

## Conditions That Promote Dollar Spot

Dollar spot develops when specific environmental conditions align. Understanding these conditions helps you predict when dollar spot is likely and take preventive action.

**Temperature Range**

Dollar spot thrives when temperatures are between 60-85°F. This is narrower than the temperature range favoring many lawn diseases. In Jacksonville's climate, this temperature sweet spot occurs during spring (April-May) and fall (September-October).

Summer temperatures consistently in the 90s actually suppress dollar spot, which is why we see it disappear during July-August even if other conditions remain favorable. Winter temperatures below 60°F also prevent dollar spot development, though this is less relevant in Jacksonville where winter temperatures regularly exceed 60°F during afternoon hours.

The transition periods—April-May as temperatures rise toward summer heat, and September-October as they fall from summer highs—provide sustained periods of dollar spot-favorable temperatures. These are your high-alert periods for dollar spot watching.

**Heavy Dew and Humidity**

Dollar spot requires leaf wetness to germinate and infect grass. In Jacksonville, heavy dew formation is nearly universal during spring and fall due to our proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and St. Johns River combined with clear nights that allow radiational cooling.

Morning relative humidity of 90-100% is common in Jacksonville during spring and fall, creating thick dew that keeps grass blades wet from evening until mid-morning—easily 10-14 hours of leaf wetness. This exceeds the 10-12 hours dollar spot needs to establish infection.

Neighborhoods close to water—Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, Riverside along the St. Johns, areas bordering creeks and retention ponds in Mandarin and Southside—tend to see heavier dew and more consistent dollar spot problems than inland areas.

**Low Nitrogen Levels**

This is dollar spot's unique characteristic: it thrives on nitrogen-deficient turf. While most lawn diseases are promoted by excessive nitrogen (gray leaf spot, brown patch), dollar spot prefers underfed lawns.

The mechanism is straightforward. Nitrogen promotes leaf growth and cell wall strength. Nitrogen-deficient grass has thinner cell walls that the dollar spot fungus penetrates more easily. Well-fertilized grass with robust cell walls resists infection even when environmental conditions favor disease.

This is why dollar spot often appears in April-May and September-October—these are transition periods when homeowners typically haven't fertilized in 2-3 months. The last fall application was back in September or October, the spring application hasn't been made yet, and nitrogen levels have depleted over winter.

**Drought Stress**

Oddly, while dollar spot requires moisture (dew) to infect grass, it's promoted by drought stress in the soil. This apparent contradiction makes sense when you understand the mechanism. Drought stress weakens grass, making it more susceptible to disease. Morning dew provides the moisture for infection, but underlying drought stress provides the vulnerable host.

In Jacksonville, this combination occurs frequently during April-May. Afternoon temperatures are warm, rainfall hasn't reached summer levels yet, and many homeowners haven't increased irrigation frequency from winter levels. Grass experiences moisture stress during the day, then dew provides leaf wetness at night—perfect dollar spot conditions.

**Compacted Soil and Poor Drainage**

Soil compaction reduces root growth and water infiltration, creating stress that increases dollar spot susceptibility. Areas of high foot traffic, where lawn equipment regularly crosses, or where soil naturally contains heavy clay all tend to show more severe dollar spot.

Poor drainage creates similar stress. Areas that stay wet after rain or irrigation while surrounding areas dry normally develop stressed root systems vulnerable to dollar spot. This is common in Jacksonville neighborhoods where lot grading is marginal or storm water systems are undersized.

## Dollar Spot Treatment Options

The good news about dollar spot is that treatment is often simpler than for other lawn diseases. In many cases, addressing the nitrogen deficiency that allowed dollar spot to develop resolves the disease without fungicide application.

### Nitrogen Fertilization as Primary Treatment

Because dollar spot is fundamentally a disease of nitrogen-deficient turf, fertilization is both treatment and cure in most Jacksonville cases.

**Application Rate and Timing**

When dollar spot symptoms appear, apply nitrogen fertilizer at 0.5-1.0 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet. This provides enough nitrogen to stimulate recovery growth and increase disease resistance without promoting excessive growth that can trigger other diseases.

Use a fertilizer with at least 50% slow-release nitrogen to provide extended feeding rather than a quick green-up followed by crash. Good choices include products with sulfur-coated urea or polymer-coated urea.

Apply fertilizer when grass is dry, water it in with 0.25 inches of irrigation, and mow within 3-5 days to stimulate lateral growth into affected areas. You should see new green growth within 7-10 days, and spots should begin filling in within 2-3 weeks.

**Why This Works**

Nitrogen application doesn't kill the dollar spot fungus—it strengthens the grass so it can resist infection and outgrow damage. The fungus likely remains present in the lawn, but healthy, well-fed grass keeps it from causing visible symptoms.

This approach works for mild to moderate dollar spot infections. If you have severe infestation with hundreds of spots covering more than 30-40% of the lawn, or if dollar spot continues progressing despite fertilization, fungicide application may be necessary.

**Fertilization Alone Success Rate**

At Jax Sod, we estimate that 60-70% of dollar spot cases in Jacksonville resolve with nitrogen fertilization alone, no fungicide needed. This success rate is higher in spring (when grass is actively growing and responds quickly to fertilizer) than in fall (when growth slows and recovery takes longer).

The financial benefit is significant. A fertilizer application costs $20-40 for a typical 5,000 square foot lawn, while fungicide treatment costs $80-150. If fertilization solves the problem, you've saved money while achieving the same result.

### Fungicide Treatment for Severe Cases

When fertilization alone doesn't control dollar spot, or when disease severity requires immediate action to prevent massive turf loss, fungicide application is warranted.

**Effective Active Ingredients**

Several fungicide active ingredients effectively control dollar spot:

**Propiconazole** (found in Honor Guard, Quali-Pro, Fertilome brands) is widely available at local Jacksonville garden centers and provides 14-28 days of control. Apply at labeled rates and repeat every 14-21 days while conditions favor disease.

**Myclobutanil** (Immunox, Spectracide brands) is another readily available option with similar effectiveness to propiconazole. Like all DMI-class fungicides, it works both preventively and curatively if applied early in disease development.

**Azoxystrobin** (Heritage, Scotts DiseaseEx) provides excellent dollar spot control and longer residual activity (21-28 days). It's more expensive than propiconazole but requires fewer applications.

**Thiophanate-methyl** (Cleary's 3336, others) is an older fungicide that still provides good dollar spot control, though resistance has developed in some areas from overuse.

**Application Guidelines**

Apply fungicides when dollar spot symptoms first appear and environmental conditions favor disease (temperatures 60-85°F, heavy dew, drought stress present). Apply in early morning or evening when temperatures are below 85°F and wind is minimal.

Use liquid formulations rather than granular when possible. Liquid fungicides provide better coverage of leaf surfaces where dollar spot infects. If using granular, water in immediately with 0.25 inches of irrigation.

Apply the fungicide uniformly across the entire lawn, not just spotted areas. Dollar spot spreads, and treating only visible symptoms leaves untreated areas vulnerable to infection.

**Combining Fertilization and Fungicide**

For severe dollar spot, the most effective approach combines both strategies: fungicide to stop immediate disease progression, followed by nitrogen fertilization 7-10 days later to promote recovery growth.

This combination typically produces visible improvement within 7 days (new infection stops), complete control within 14 days (fungicide effectiveness), and full recovery within 4-6 weeks (new growth fills in spots).

### Organic Treatment Options

Homeowners seeking to avoid synthetic fungicides have limited options for dollar spot control. The most effective organic approach is excellent nitrogen management with organic nitrogen sources.

**Organic Nitrogen Sources**

Organic fertilizers like Milorganite, blood meal, feather meal, or composted poultry manure provide slow-release nitrogen from natural sources. Apply at rates providing 0.5-1.0 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet.

Organic nitrogen sources release slowly, so apply early at the first sign of dollar spot. It may take 2-3 weeks to see improvement, compared to 7-10 days with synthetic nitrogen.

**Compost Tea and Biostimulants**

Products containing beneficial microorganisms (compost tea, products with Bacillus subtilis or Trichoderma species) may provide modest disease suppression. Research shows inconsistent results, but some Jacksonville homeowners report success with regular applications during disease-favorable periods.

These products work best preventively rather than curatively. If you choose this approach, apply every 7-14 days starting in March (before dollar spot season) and continuing through May, then again starting in August through October.

## Cultural Prevention Strategies

The most cost-effective dollar spot management is prevention through cultural practices that keep grass healthy and reduce disease-favorable conditions.

### Nitrogen Management

Since low nitrogen is dollar spot's primary predisposing factor, proper fertilization is your most important prevention tool.

**Annual Nitrogen Application**

Bermuda lawns need 3-5 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet annually, split into 4-6 applications during the growing season. Zoysia needs 2-4 pounds annually, split into 3-4 applications.

For dollar spot prevention, the key is maintaining consistent nitrogen levels during transition seasons (April-May and September-October) when dollar spot risk peaks. Many Jacksonville homeowners make the mistake of fertilizing heavily in summer (June-July) then skipping spring and fall applications. This creates the nitrogen deficiency that invites dollar spot.

**Fertilization Schedule for Dollar Spot Prevention**

For Bermuda lawns:
- March 15-April 1: 1.0 lb N (prevents spring dollar spot)
- May 15-31: 1.0 lb N (promotes summer growth)
- July 1-15: 0.75 lb N (maintain summer health)
- September 1-15: 1.0 lb N (prevents fall dollar spot)
- Optional November: 0.5 lb N (winter hardiness)

For Zoysia lawns:
- April 1-15: 0.75 lb N (spring greenup and dollar spot prevention)
- June 1-15: 0.75 lb N (summer growth)
- August 15-31: 0.75 lb N (fall dollar spot prevention)
- Optional October: 0.5 lb N (fall growth)

Notice that both schedules include applications timed specifically for dollar spot prevention during the April-May and September periods when the disease peaks.

### Irrigation Management

Proper irrigation reduces dollar spot risk while maintaining lawn health—a delicate balance in Jacksonville's climate.

**Reduce Dew Formation**

While you can't eliminate dew (it's a natural result of overnight cooling), you can reduce its impact. Avoid evening irrigation, which adds moisture on top of natural dew formation. Irrigate early morning (4am-8am) so grass blades dry quickly as the day warms.

Deep, infrequent irrigation (0.5-0.75 inches twice weekly) maintains soil moisture without keeping grass blades constantly wet. This is better than shallow daily watering, which keeps foliage wet and promotes disease.

**Address Drought Stress**

Remember that dollar spot is promoted by drought stress even though it requires leaf wetness to infect. During April-May and September-October in Jacksonville, monitor soil moisture carefully. Don't let the lawn become drought-stressed just because afternoon temperatures aren't as extreme as July-August.

Use the screwdriver test: push a long screwdriver into the soil. It should penetrate 6 inches easily if moisture is adequate. If it meets resistance at 3-4 inches, increase irrigation frequency.

### Mowing Practices

Mowing height and frequency significantly affect dollar spot development and severity.

**Maintain Proper Height**

Mow Bermuda at 1.5-2 inches for home lawns (golf course heights of 0.5-1 inch dramatically increase dollar spot risk). Mow Zoysia at 1.5-2.5 inches. Lower mowing heights stress grass and increase susceptibility to all diseases, including dollar spot.

Taller grass has more leaf area for photosynthesis, deeper roots for stress tolerance, and thicker cell walls that resist infection. If you're fighting recurring dollar spot, raising mowing height by 0.5 inches often provides noticeable improvement.

**Mowing Frequency**

Mow frequently enough to remove no more than one-third of leaf blade height per cutting. During active growth periods (April-May and September-October, which coincidentally are dollar spot season), this means weekly mowing for Bermuda, every 7-10 days for Zoysia.

Frequent mowing removes older leaf tissue that may be infected before disease spreads to healthy tissue. It also stimulates lateral growth that helps spots fill in faster once disease is controlled.

**Blade Sharpness and Cleanliness**

Sharp mower blades cut cleanly, reducing leaf damage that creates entry points for disease. Dull blades shred leaf tips, creating ragged wounds that dollar spot can infect easily.

If dollar spot is present, mow infected areas last, then wash the mower deck with a 10% bleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) to kill spores before mowing healthy areas. This prevents spreading disease via contaminated equipment.

### Soil Management

Healthy soil grows healthy grass that resists dollar spot. Several soil factors affect susceptibility.

**Core Aeration**

Core aeration reduces soil compaction, improves water infiltration, and promotes root growth. Healthier, deeper roots mean less stress and better disease resistance.

Aerate Bermuda and Zoysia lawns in May or June when grass is actively growing and can quickly recover. For lawns with dollar spot history, consider aerating every year rather than every 2-3 years.

**pH Management**

Dollar spot is influenced by soil pH. Slightly acidic to neutral pH (6.0-7.0) is optimal for Bermuda and Zoysia growth. Very acidic soils (below 5.5) or alkaline soils (above 7.5) stress grass and increase dollar spot susceptibility.

Test soil pH every 2-3 years. Jacksonville soils are typically slightly acidic (pH 5.5-6.5), but coastal areas can have higher pH from shell-based soils, and some inland areas have very low pH. Adjust with lime (to raise pH) or sulfur (to lower pH) as needed.

**Thatch Management**

Thatch over 0.5 inches holds moisture, reduces air circulation, and harbors disease organisms. Bermuda accumulates thatch faster than other grasses and may need annual dethatching or power raking.

Check thatch depth in early spring by cutting a small plug from the lawn and measuring the layer of brown organic matter between soil and green grass. If it exceeds 0.5 inches, dethatch in May when Bermuda is actively growing.

## Lawn Recovery After Dollar Spot

Once dollar spot is controlled through fertilization and/or fungicide, recovery time depends on grass type, severity of damage, and growing conditions.

**Bermuda Recovery**

Bermuda's aggressive spreading habit means it recovers from dollar spot relatively quickly. Small spots (2-3 inches) in lightly affected lawns may completely fill in within 2-3 weeks after treatment. Larger merged areas or severely affected lawns may take 4-6 weeks.

Promote recovery by:
- Maintaining adequate nitrogen (0.75-1.0 lb N per 1,000 sq ft monthly during growing season)
- Proper irrigation (0.5-0.75 inches twice weekly)
- Regular mowing to stimulate lateral growth
- Light topdressing (0.25-0.5 inches) of sand or compost to encourage runner growth

**Zoysia Recovery**

Zoysia spreads more slowly than Bermuda, so recovery takes longer—typically 4-6 weeks for small spots, 8-12 weeks for severe damage. The same recovery practices that help Bermuda also apply to Zoysia, but patience is required.

For severe Zoysia damage where large bare areas remain after dollar spot is controlled, consider plugging bare spots with Zoysia sod plugs on 6-12 inch centers. This accelerates recovery compared to waiting for natural fill-in.

**When Recovery Doesn't Happen**

If treated areas aren't showing new growth within 3-4 weeks, the grass may be completely dead rather than just dormant. This sometimes happens with severe dollar spot infections where the fungus killed crown tissue, not just leaf blades.

Dead crowns won't regenerate. These areas need resodding. Remove dead grass, ensure soil is healthy (pH 6.0-7.0, adequate phosphorus for root establishment), and lay fresh sod matching your existing grass variety.

## Seasonal Timing in Jacksonville

Dollar spot risk follows a predictable seasonal pattern in Northeast Florida, allowing you to plan preventive actions.

### Spring Peak (April-May)

This is Jacksonville's primary dollar spot season. Temperatures rise into the 60-85°F range, heavy dew forms nightly, rainfall is moderate, and nitrogen levels have depleted over winter.

**Prevention Actions:**
- Fertilize in late March to early April before symptoms appear
- Monitor lawns weekly for early symptoms
- Address irrigation system issues before peak growing season
- Have fungicide on hand if you have dollar spot history

**Treatment Window:**

If dollar spot appears despite prevention, treat immediately. Spring-applied treatments work quickly because grass is actively growing and responds well to fertilization and fungicide.

### Summer Dormant Period (June-August)

Jacksonville's summer heat typically suppresses dollar spot. Temperatures consistently above 85°F prevent the fungus from thriving, even if other conditions remain favorable.

This is when you can relax about dollar spot and focus on other summer disease concerns (gray leaf spot on St. Augustine, take-all root rot in poorly drained areas). However, maintain adequate nitrogen through summer to ensure grass enters fall in healthy condition.

### Fall Peak (September-October)

As temperatures moderate from summer highs, dollar spot returns. This is Jacksonville's secondary dollar spot season, generally less severe than spring but still significant.

**Prevention Actions:**
- Fertilize in late August to early September
- Resume close lawn monitoring
- Ensure irrigation is adequate as rainfall decreases
- Address any summer stress damage before fall dollar spot season

**Treatment Window:**

Fall dollar spot treatments work but recovery is slower than spring treatments because grass growth slows as winter approaches. Treat promptly to allow maximum recovery time before winter dormancy.

### Winter Dormancy (November-February)

Bermuda enters dormancy when nighttime temperatures consistently stay below 60°F, typically by mid-November in Jacksonville. Zoysia maintains some green color through winter but growth is minimal.

Dollar spot doesn't develop on dormant grass. This is when you plan for next season: test soil, schedule spring core aeration, assess whether grass variety changes might reduce disease pressure, and prepare fertilizer applications for spring.

## Cost Comparison: Prevention vs. Treatment

Understanding the economics of dollar spot management helps homeowners make informed decisions about prevention investments.

**Annual Prevention Program (5,000 sq ft lawn):**
- March fertilization (1 lb N): $35
- September fertilization (1 lb N): $35
- Soil testing and pH adjustment if needed: $50 every 3 years ($17 annually)
- Total annual cost: ~$87

**Treatment Program if Dollar Spot Develops:**
- Nitrogen fertilization: $35
- Fungicide application (2-3 applications if severe): $150-225
- Possible resodding if damage is severe: $500-1,500
- Total cost: $185-1,760 depending on severity

Prevention is dramatically cheaper than treatment, especially if dollar spot becomes severe enough to require resodding. The $87 annual investment in prevention saves hundreds to thousands in treatment and repair costs.

## Jacksonville Neighborhood-Specific Considerations

Different areas of Jacksonville face different dollar spot challenges based on local conditions.

**Coastal Areas (Beaches, Ponte Vedra):**

Heavy dew from ocean proximity increases dollar spot risk, but sandy soils with excellent drainage reduce stress. Focus on maintaining adequate nitrogen and avoiding drought stress during spring/fall transition periods.

**Inland Clay Soils (Arlington, Westside, Clay County):**

Heavy clay soils create drainage problems that stress grass and promote dollar spot. Focus on core aeration, improving drainage, and adjusting irrigation to avoid overwatering that stresses roots while maintaining adequate soil moisture.

**Shaded Neighborhoods (San Marco, Riverside, Avondale):**

Heavy tree canopy extends dew periods and reduces air circulation. Dollar spot risk is elevated. Consider raising mowing height, improving air circulation through selective tree pruning, and being especially vigilant about spring/fall fertilization.

**New Developments (Nocatee, Julington Creek, St. Johns):**

Construction-damaged or minimally-amended soils create stress. Dollar spot often appears in the first 2-3 years after sod installation. Focus on soil improvement (organic matter, pH adjustment) and adequate fertilization while grass establishes.

## Conclusion

Dollar spot is one of the most common lawn diseases affecting Jacksonville's Bermuda and Zoysia lawns, but it's also one of the most preventable and treatable. Unlike many lawn diseases that require fungicide intervention, dollar spot often responds to simple nitrogen fertilization—making it both economical and environmentally friendly to manage.

The key to dollar spot management is understanding that it's fundamentally a disease of nitrogen-deficient turf. By maintaining adequate fertility during spring and fall transition periods when dollar spot peaks, you can often prevent the disease entirely. When it does appear, early intervention with fertilization addresses most cases, with fungicide reserved for severe infections.

Jacksonville's climate will always favor some dollar spot development during April-May and September-October. The goal isn't to eliminate all risk—an impossible task—but to minimize severity through good cultural practices and treat promptly when disease appears. A few scattered spots that resolve within 2-3 weeks after fertilization is a success. Hundreds of spots requiring multiple fungicide applications and months of recovery time indicates a need for better prevention strategies.
