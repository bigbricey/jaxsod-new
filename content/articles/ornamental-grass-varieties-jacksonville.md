# Ornamental Grass Varieties for Jacksonville Landscapes

Ornamental grasses have quietly revolutionized Jacksonville landscaping over the past decade, and for good reason. While St. Augustine and Zoysia lawns serve their purpose, ornamental grasses bring movement, texture, seasonal interest, and drama that traditional foundation shrubs simply can't match. After 37 years working in Northeast Florida landscapes, we've watched ornamental grasses Jacksonville homeowners once considered "field weeds" become design centerpieces commanding premium nursery prices.

What makes ornamental grasses so successful in our region? They thrive in conditions that challenge other plants: full sun, sandy soil, summer heat, humidity, drought, salt spray, and even occasional flooding. Many are Florida natives perfectly adapted to our climate. They require minimal maintenance—no deadheading, no spraying, usually just one annual cutback. And unlike perennials that bloom for a few weeks then fade into the background, ornamental grasses provide four-season interest with foliage, flowers, seed heads, and often stunning fall color.

Whether you're looking to replace struggling lawn areas in Mandarin, create privacy screening in Ponte Vedra, add cottage-garden charm to your San Marco bungalow, or incorporate native plants in a Florida-Friendly landscape in Nocatee, there's an ornamental grass perfectly suited to your needs. This guide covers the varieties that perform best in Jacksonville's unique climate, from compact border grasses to massive statement plants, and how to incorporate them successfully in your landscape.

## Why Ornamental Grasses Excel in Jacksonville

Before diving into specific varieties, let's understand why ornamental grasses are such winners in Northeast Florida. Our climate presents challenges: scorching summers with 90°F+ temperatures for months, sandy soil that drains quickly but holds few nutrients, occasional droughts followed by heavy downpours, salt spray in coastal areas, and winters just cold enough to kill tropical plants but too warm for many cold-season plants.

Ornamental grasses evolved in grasslands, prairies, and coastal dunes—environments similar to Jacksonville's conditions. Many of the best performers for our area are native to the southeastern United States or similar climate zones worldwide. This evolutionary adaptation means they handle our weather extremes without the constant intervention other ornamental plants require.

From a practical standpoint, ornamental grasses offer Jacksonville homeowners several advantages:

**Drought tolerance:** Once established (6-12 months after planting), most ornamental grasses survive on rainfall alone, even during the dry spring months when St. Johns River Water Management District watering restrictions limit irrigation to twice weekly.

**Low maintenance:** One annual cutback in late winter (February-March in Jacksonville) constitutes the primary maintenance. No deadheading, no staking, no spraying for disease or pests.

**Deer resistance:** In western Duval, Clay County, and St. Johns County where deer browsing damages landscapes, ornamental grasses remain largely untouched. The tough, often sharp-edged foliage isn't palatable.

**Adaptability:** Full sun to partial shade, wet to dry soil, coastal salt spray—the right grass selection handles whatever conditions your property presents.

**Year-round interest:** Unlike perennials that bloom briefly then look average, grasses provide foliage texture all growing season, dramatic flowers and seed heads summer through fall, and architectural winter structure when most landscapes look dormant.

Let's explore the specific varieties that deliver these benefits in Jacksonville landscapes.

## Muhly Grass: The Fall Star

### Pink Muhly Grass (Muhlenbergia capillaris)

If forced to choose one ornamental grass for Jacksonville, pink muhly grass would be the winner. This Florida native puts on a spectacular fall display that stops traffic. From September through November, the fine-textured green foliage (growing in a fountain shape 2-3 feet tall and wide) sends up airy, cotton-candy-pink plumes that hover above the plant, creating a cloud-like effect. The pink color intensifies as temperatures cool, remaining attractive for 6-8 weeks.

During the non-blooming season, muhly grass provides nice texture without demanding attention. The fine, hair-like foliage stays green year-round in Jacksonville (it's evergreen in our mild winters) and requires virtually zero maintenance beyond the annual late-winter cutback.

In Jacksonville landscapes from Riverside to Baymeadows, we plant muhly grass in masses for stunning impact—imagine 10, 20, or 50 plants flowering simultaneously in a pink haze. Single specimens work well as accents, but the true magic happens in groups. Space plants 2-3 feet apart for individual specimens or 18-24 inches for a meadow effect where plants merge into one another.

Muhly grass handles full sun (6+ hours) best, producing the most abundant flowers. It tolerates partial shade (4-6 hours of sun) but blooms less prolifically. The grass adapts to almost any soil, from pure sand to clay, wet to dry. In Atlantic Beach, Jacksonville Beach, and Neptune Beach, muhly grass tolerates salt spray, making it perfect for coastal landscapes.

Cost runs $15-$35 per gallon container depending on size and source. Considering the long-term value and minimal maintenance, muhly grass may be the best landscaping investment available in Northeast Florida.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Plant muhly grass where low-angle fall sunlight can backlight the pink plumes—along west-facing fences, in front of dark evergreen backgrounds, or where evening light from the west creates a glowing effect. The translucent flowers are most dramatic when backlit.

### White Muhly Grass (Muhlenbergia capillaris 'White Cloud')

For homeowners preferring subtler color schemes, white muhly grass offers the same growth habit and fall display as pink muhly but with creamy-white plumes. The effect is softer, elegant, and sophisticated, working particularly well with modern architecture in Town Center or against dark-colored homes.

White muhly pairs beautifully with pink muhly in combination plantings. The color contrast creates depth and interest. All growing requirements and maintenance match pink muhly grass exactly.

## Fakahatchee Grass: The Evergreen Foundation

### Fakahatchee Grass (Tripsacum dactyloides)

If muhly grass is the flashy star, fakahatchee grass is the reliable workhorse. This Florida native forms dense, fountain-shaped clumps 2-4 feet tall and wide with dark green, arching foliage that stays attractive year-round. The flowers are inconspicuous (this isn't a grass you grow for blooms), but the consistent, refined appearance makes it invaluable for foundation plantings, borders, and mass plantings where reliable texture matters more than seasonal drama.

Fakahatchee grass tolerates extreme conditions: full sun to deep shade (one of the most shade-tolerant ornamental grasses), wet to dry soil, sandy or clay soil, and even occasional flooding. In Arlington, Mandarin, and Southside neighborhoods where lawn grass struggles in shade beneath oak canopies, fakahatchee grass thrives with zero effort.

We use fakahatchee grass as a low hedge (plant 2-3 feet apart for a continuous border), as foundation plantings around homes (it never gets unruly or requires trimming during the growing season), and as transition plantings between lawn areas and natural spaces. The fine-textured foliage creates a soft visual effect compared to bold-leaved plants like hostas or elephant ears.

Maintenance is minimal: cut back once in late winter (February-March) to remove old foliage before new growth emerges. During the growing season, fakahatchee grass requires zero attention. It's evergreen in Jacksonville but looks fresher after the annual cutback.

Fakahatchee grass spreads slowly via rhizomes, gradually increasing the clump size over years. It's never invasive but will fill in gaps, making it excellent for erosion control on slopes in Orange Park, Fleming Island, and Fruit Cove properties.

Cost is typically $12-$25 per gallon container. Given the adaptability and minimal care requirements, it's one of the best values in Jacksonville landscaping.

## Fountain Grass Varieties

### Pennisetum: The Classic Ornamental

Fountain grass (Pennisetum setaceum and related species) encompasses several varieties popular in Jacksonville landscapes. The name comes from the graceful, fountain-like growth habit: narrow foliage arching from the center, topped with fuzzy, bottle-brush-like flower spikes from summer through fall.

**Purple Fountain Grass (Pennisetum setaceum 'Rubrum')** brings bold color to Jacksonville landscapes with burgundy-purple foliage and dark pink-purple plumes. Growing 3-4 feet tall and wide, it creates dramatic contrast against green lawns or light-colored homes. The color remains intense all summer, fading slightly in extreme heat but refreshing with fall temperatures.

Purple fountain grass thrives in full sun and well-draining soil—perfect for Jacksonville's sandy conditions. It requires moderate water during establishment but becomes relatively drought-tolerant once established. This is technically a tender perennial in Jacksonville, occasionally suffering winter damage during hard freezes but usually recovering from the root system. Annual cutback in late winter removes any freeze-damaged foliage.

In Nocatee, Deerwood, and Jacksonville Beach landscapes, purple fountain grass works beautifully in contemporary designs, combining with agave, yucca, and tropical plants for bold, architectural looks. Space 3-4 feet apart for individual specimens.

**Dwarf Fountain Grass (Pennisetum alopecuroides 'Hameln')** offers a more compact option, growing 2-3 feet tall with green foliage and creamy-tan flower spikes. This variety handles partial shade better than purple fountain grass and shows better winter hardiness, making it reliable even in inland Jacksonville areas like Middleburg and Yulee that experience occasional hard freezes.

Fountain grasses cost $15-$30 per gallon container and provide outstanding value with their long bloom period and attractive foliage.

## Lemongrass: Multi-Purpose Beauty

### Lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus)

Here's an ornamental grass that works double duty in Jacksonville landscapes: visual appeal and practical function. Lemongrass forms dense clumps 3-5 feet tall and wide with bright green, upright foliage that remains attractive spring through fall. The citrus fragrance (strongest when leaves are bruised or crushed) acts as a natural mosquito deterrent—not perfect, but helpful during those summer evening backyard barbecues.

The bonus: lemongrass is a culinary herb used extensively in Asian cooking. Harvest the tender inner stalks for soups, curries, and teas. Each clump produces more than enough for regular cooking use while still maintaining landscape appearance.

Lemongrass thrives in Jacksonville's heat and humidity, growing vigorously from April through October. It's technically tropical and will die back to the ground during freezes, but the root system survives and regrows each spring. Treat it as an annual foliage plant that returns perennially from roots, similar to cannas or gingers.

Plant lemongrass in full sun and provide regular water during the growing season (it tolerates our summer rainfall patterns well). Cut back dead foliage in late winter before new growth emerges. Divide clumps every 2-3 years to maintain vigor and share with neighbors.

In Riverside, Avondale, and San Marco gardens where cottage-garden aesthetics and edible landscaping overlap, lemongrass is perfect. It also works well in containers on patios or near outdoor kitchen areas where the culinary connection makes sense.

Cost runs $10-$20 per gallon container. The combination of ornamental value, mosquito-deterrent properties, and culinary use makes lemongrass an exceptional value.

## Mondo Grass: The Grasslike Groundcover

### Mondo Grass and Dwarf Mondo Grass (Ophiopogon japonicus)

Technically, mondo grass isn't a true grass—it's a member of the lily family. But its grasslike appearance earns it a place in any ornamental grass discussion. Mondo grass and its dwarf variety form dense, clumping groundcovers 4-8 inches tall (dwarf) or 8-12 inches tall (standard) with dark green, narrow foliage that stays evergreen year-round in Jacksonville.

The flowers (small, white or pale purple spikes in summer) are inconspicuous, followed by blue-black berries. The real value is the dense, weed-suppressing foliage that works as an alternative to mulch or traditional groundcovers.

Mondo grass excels in situations where other plants struggle: deep shade beneath trees, narrow planting strips between sidewalks and homes, around the base of trees where lawn grass won't grow, and as borders edging walkways or beds. In Jacksonville's sandy soil, mondo grass establishes slowly (12-18 months to fill in completely) but becomes virtually indestructible once established.

We use dwarf mondo grass in Baymeadows, Town Center, and Ponte Vedra landscapes as a formal edging plant, creating crisp, defined borders 4-6 inches tall. The low height ensures it never obscures hardscaping edges or requires trimming. Standard mondo grass works well as a taller groundcover or foundation planting in shade.

Space mondo grass plants 6-8 inches apart for relatively quick coverage (12-18 months) or 10-12 inches for slower but more economical coverage (24-36 months). Once established, it requires virtually zero maintenance—no mowing, no trimming, occasional watering during extended droughts.

Mondo grass tolerates full sun in Jacksonville if provided adequate moisture, but it performs best in partial to full shade. It handles wet or dry soil once established.

Cost for mondo grass: $3-$8 per 4-inch pot, sold in flats of 18. Dwarf mondo grass costs slightly more: $5-$10 per 4-inch pot. The initial investment for covering large areas adds up, but the long-term, maintenance-free performance justifies the cost.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Black mondo grass (Ophiopogon planiscapus 'Nigrescens'), with dramatic near-black foliage, creates stunning contrast in shade gardens. It's more expensive ($10-$15 per pot) and slower-growing but provides unique color unavailable from other shade plants.

## Aztec Grass: The Variegated Border

### Aztec Grass (Liriope muscari 'Aztec')

Like mondo grass, liriope (often called lily turf) isn't a true grass but looks and functions like one in landscapes. Aztec grass specifically offers variegated foliage—green with bright yellow edges—that brightens shaded areas and creates contrast in mixed plantings.

Growing 12-15 inches tall and wide, Aztec grass forms clumping plants that spread slowly, never becoming invasive. The grass sends up purple flower spikes in summer, followed by black berries that persist into fall. The real show is the year-round variegated foliage that remains evergreen in Jacksonville's mild winters.

Aztec grass works beautifully as edging along walkways, driveways, and beds in Mandarin, Fruit Cove, and Orange Park landscapes. The bright yellow variegation stands out against dark mulch or green lawn, creating definition and visual interest. Plant 12-15 inches apart for relatively quick coverage.

This grass tolerates full sun to full shade, though the variegation is most pronounced in partial shade. Too much sun can bleach the yellow to nearly white; deep shade reduces the contrast. Well-draining soil is important—Aztec grass sulks in constantly wet areas.

Maintenance involves cutting back old foliage in late winter before new growth emerges. During the growing season, Aztec grass requires zero attention. Divide clumps every 3-5 years if they become too large or lose vigor in the center.

Cost runs $8-$15 per gallon container. Standard green liriope costs less ($5-$10) if variegation isn't needed, but the bright foliage of Aztec grass provides unique value in shaded landscapes.

## Pampas Grass: The Bold Statement

### Pampas Grass (Cortaderia selloana)

Pampas grass isn't subtle. This massive grass forms clumps 6-10 feet tall and equally wide, topped with showy white, pink, or cream plumes that can reach 12 feet or more in late summer and fall. The dramatic scale makes pampas grass appropriate only in large landscapes with ample space—Nocatee, Ponte Vedra, or suburban properties with expansive yards.

In the right setting, pampas grass creates an unforgettable focal point. The plumes last for months, remaining attractive through fall and into winter. The foliage (long, narrow, and sharp-edged—wear gloves when handling) provides textural interest even before flowering.

Pampas grass thrives in Jacksonville's full sun, sandy soil, and tolerates drought, salt spray, and neglect. It's nearly indestructible once established, which is both a feature and a potential problem. In some parts of the country, pampas grass becomes invasive. In Jacksonville, it spreads minimally via seed but can grow aggressively large if given resources.

Plant pampas grass where its mature size works: property borders, large island beds in expansive lawns, or as screening (one pampas grass provides more screening than 10 shrubs). Give it 10-12 feet of space in all directions. Don't plant near walkways (the sharp-edged foliage cuts skin), near structures (it overwhelms), or in small yards.

Maintenance involves cutting back the entire clump in late winter. This is serious work—wear protective gear, use loppers or a chainsaw for large clumps, and expect a workout. Some Jacksonville homeowners hire professionals to handle pampas grass cutback.

Several varieties offer different plume colors:
- **'Pumila'**: Dwarf version, 4-6 feet tall (more manageable)
- **'Silver Comet'**: White plumes, variegated foliage
- **'Rosea'**: Pink plumes

Cost: $25-$50 per gallon, $50-$100 for 3-gallon containers. Given the size and maintenance requirements, consider carefully before planting pampas grass. In the right location, it's spectacular. In too-small spaces, it's a maintenance nightmare.

## Using Ornamental Grasses to Replace Lawn

One of the most practical applications of ornamental grasses in Jacksonville involves replacing lawn in difficult areas. If you're fighting St. Augustine fungus in shade, watching Bermuda die in poor drainage, or simply tired of mowing slopes or hard-to-reach areas, ornamental grasses offer solutions.

### Shade Areas Beneath Trees

Traditional lawn grasses struggle in shade beneath Jacksonville's mature oaks. Rather than fighting this battle year after year (overseeding, dealing with fungus, tolerating thin, weedy turf), replace shaded lawn with shade-tolerant ornamental grasses:

- **Fakahatchee grass**: Handles deep shade, evergreen, requires one annual cutback
- **Mondo grass**: Creates dense, grasslike groundcover 6-12 inches tall
- **Aztec grass**: Bright variegated foliage in partial shade

Mass planting in shade creates a no-mow, low-maintenance "lawn alternative" that actually looks better than struggling turf. The initial investment (plants plus labor) equals 2-3 years of sod replacement and maintenance costs, after which the grass area requires minimal care indefinitely.

### Slopes and Erosion-Prone Areas

Mowing slopes is dangerous and time-consuming. In Orange Park, Fleming Island, Fruit Cove, and other hilly areas of Clay County, ornamental grasses stabilize slopes while eliminating mowing:

- **Muhly grass**: Extensive root system prevents erosion
- **Fakahatchee grass**: Spreads slowly via rhizomes, binding soil
- **Fountain grass**: Deep roots anchor soil on slopes

Plant grasses 2-3 feet apart on slopes, mulching between plants initially. Within 1-2 years, the grasses fill in, creating continuous coverage that stabilizes soil during Jacksonville's heavy summer rains.

### Narrow, Awkward Spaces

Side yards, planting strips between sidewalk and street, areas around air conditioning units—these spaces are awkward to mow and often too narrow for riding mowers. Ornamental grasses transform these problem areas into attractive, maintenance-free zones:

- **Dwarf mondo grass**: Low, formal appearance for narrow strips
- **Muhly grass**: Adds color and interest to boring side yards
- **Lemongrass**: Provides screening and mosquito-deterrent properties

The result: fewer areas requiring weekly mowing, more visual interest, and less maintenance overall.

## Planting and Maintenance in Jacksonville

Ornamental grasses are low-maintenance, but proper planting establishes them successfully in Jacksonville's sandy soil.

### Planting Technique

**Timing:** Plant ornamental grasses spring through early fall in Jacksonville. Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) plantings establish faster with less watering, but summer planting works fine with adequate irrigation.

**Site preparation:** Dig planting holes 2-3 times wider than the container but no deeper. In Jacksonville's sand, amending soil is optional—most ornamental grasses prefer unamended, well-draining sandy soil. Remove grass and weeds from the planting area.

**Spacing:** Follow variety-specific guidelines, but generally:
- Small grasses (mondo, dwarf fountain grass): 12-18 inches apart
- Medium grasses (muhly, fakahatchee): 2-3 feet apart
- Large grasses (pampas, standard fountain grass): 4-6 feet apart

**Planting depth:** Set grass at the same depth it was growing in the container, never deeper. Jacksonville's sand settles, so planting slightly high prevents the crown from ending up too deep and rotting.

**Initial watering:** Water deeply at planting, then daily for the first week, every other day the second week, twice weekly for months 2-3, then weekly as needed until established (usually 6-12 months). Once established, most ornamental grasses survive on rainfall alone in Jacksonville.

### Annual Cutback

The primary maintenance for ornamental grasses occurs in late winter: cutting back old foliage before new growth emerges. In Jacksonville, timing is February through early March, before warm weather triggers growth.

**Tools:** Use hedge shears, loppers, or even a string trimmer for large clumps. Some homeowners bundle the foliage, tie it, and cut below the tie for easier cleanup.

**Technique:** Cut the entire clump down to 4-6 inches above ground level. Yes, this looks drastic, but new growth emerges quickly once warm weather arrives. Don't delay cutback into late March or April—you'll cut off emerging new growth.

**Disposal:** Ornamental grass foliage is often too tough for standard composting. In Jacksonville, you can:
- Bag for yard waste pickup
- Haul to local compost facilities
- Use as mulch in naturalized areas (it breaks down slowly)

### Division and Propagation

Most ornamental grasses benefit from division every 3-5 years, which rejuvenates clumps that have developed dead centers or lost vigor. In Jacksonville, divide grasses in early spring (March-April) or early fall (September-October).

Dig up the entire clump, then use a sharp spade, axe, or even a chainsaw (for large pampas grass clumps) to divide the root mass into sections. Replant divisions at the original depth, water well, and they'll establish quickly.

Division allows you to multiply plantings economically. One $20 muhly grass divided into 4-6 sections creates multiple plants for free.

## Combining Ornamental Grasses in Jacksonville Landscapes

Ornamental grasses work beautifully in mixed plantings, but thoughtful combinations create better results than random placement.

### Grasses with Perennials

Pair the fine texture of ornamental grasses with bold-leaved perennials for contrast:
- Muhly grass + canna lily: Pink plumes with colorful canna flowers
- Fakahatchee grass + hosta: Fine grass texture with broad hosta leaves (shade)
- Fountain grass + salvia: Purple grass foliage with salvia flowers

### Grasses with Shrubs

Use grasses to soften hard edges of traditional foundation shrubs:
- Standard shrubs (azalea, loropetalum, holly) in back layer
- Ornamental grasses (muhly, fountain grass) in middle layer
- Low border plants (mondo grass, dwarf liriope) in front

This three-layer approach creates depth and seasonal interest missing from single-layer shrub plantings.

### Grasses with Palms and Tropicals

The cottage-garden-meets-coastal style popular in Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Ponte Vedra combines grasses with palms beautifully:
- Pindo palm or Sabal palm as canopy
- Muhly grass, fakahatchee grass, or lemongrass as mid-layer
- Mondo grass or liriope as groundcover

Add tropical accents (bromeliad, bird of paradise, ginger) for color pops.

### Mass Plantings

For maximum impact, plant ornamental grasses in groups of 5, 7, 9, or more of the same variety. Single specimens rarely create the drama of mass plantings. In Nocatee, Deerwood, and suburban Jacksonville developments, we've installed muhly grass meadows (50+ plants) that create breathtaking fall displays.

## Deer Resistance: A Jacksonville Bonus

In western Duval County, most of Clay County, and St. Johns County areas near rural land, deer browsing is a constant landscape challenge. Homeowners in Middleburg, Yulee, Fleming Island, and western Mandarin watch deer devour hostas, daylilies, and other prized plants overnight.

Ornamental grasses are largely deer-resistant. The tough, often sharp-edged foliage isn't palatable to deer. While no plant is 100% deer-proof during severe drought when deer are desperate, ornamental grasses are rarely browsed under normal conditions.

This makes grasses invaluable in deer-prone areas. You can create beautiful landscapes without constant frustration and replanting.

## Ornamental Grass Sources in Jacksonville

Local garden centers and nurseries throughout the Jacksonville area stock ornamental grasses, with selection best in spring (March-May) and fall (September-October):

- **Independent garden centers** in Green Cove Springs, Orange Park, and Jacksonville typically offer the widest selection and healthiest specimens, plus knowledgeable staff who can recommend varieties for your specific conditions.

- **Home improvement stores** (Lowe's, Home Depot) stock common varieties (muhly grass, fountain grass, liriope, mondo grass) at competitive prices, though selection and quality vary.

- **Specialty nurseries** focusing on native plants often carry muhly grass, fakahatchee grass, and other Florida natives. These are excellent sources for quality plants grown locally.

- **Plant sales and swaps** in Jacksonville neighborhoods often feature divisions of ornamental grasses from established landscapes. These free or low-cost options work well if you're patient about filling in larger areas gradually.

Expect to pay:
- Small grasses (4-inch pots): $3-$8
- Gallon containers: $10-$25
- Three-gallon containers: $25-$50
- Five-gallon containers (pampas, large specimens): $40-$100

## Conclusion: Ornamental Grasses Transform Jacksonville Landscapes

If you're still relying solely on traditional foundation shrubs and lawn for your Jacksonville landscape, you're missing the versatility, beauty, and low-maintenance benefits ornamental grasses provide. From the spectacular fall display of muhly grass to the reliable, evergreen texture of fakahatchee grass, from the bold drama of pampas grass to the subtle elegance of dwarf mondo grass, there's an ornamental grass perfect for virtually every location and design style.

The key is matching grass varieties to your specific conditions—sun/shade, wet/dry soil, available space—and understanding mature size before planting. Start with proven performers like muhly grass and fakahatchee grass if you're new to ornamental grasses. Expand into fountain grasses, lemongrass, and specialty varieties as you gain confidence.

Ornamental grasses work beautifully in Florida-Friendly landscapes, offering drought tolerance, minimal maintenance, native plant options, and wildlife benefits (birds love the seeds). They solve difficult landscape problems like deep shade, slopes, and narrow spaces while providing four-season interest unavailable from most perennials and shrubs.

Whether you're redesigning your entire landscape or simply looking to add interest to a few beds, ornamental grasses deliver exceptional value and beauty in Jacksonville's challenging climate. The initial investment pays dividends for years with minimal ongoing care—just one annual cutback and occasional division.
