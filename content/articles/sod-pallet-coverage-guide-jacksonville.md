# Sod Pallet Coverage: How Much Does One Pallet Cover?

If you're planning a lawn installation or renovation project in Jacksonville, one of the first questions you'll need to answer is: how much sod do I need? Understanding sod pallet coverage is essential for budgeting your project, scheduling delivery, and ensuring you have enough material to complete your lawn without delays or shortages.

At Jax Sod, we've been helping Jacksonville homeowners calculate their sod needs for over 37 years. After thousands of installations across Duval, Clay, St. Johns, and Nassau Counties, we know that one of the most common sources of confusion is understanding exactly what you're getting when you order a pallet of sod. The coverage can vary significantly based on grass type, how the sod is cut, and which farm supplies it.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll break down everything you need to know about sod pallet coverage in Northeast Florida, from standard measurements to delivery logistics, so you can plan your lawn project with confidence.

## Standard Sod Pallet Coverage in Jacksonville

A standard sod pallet in the Jacksonville area typically covers between 400 and 500 square feet. However, this isn't a universal measurement. The exact coverage depends on several factors, including the grass variety, how the farm cuts and stacks the sod, and whether you're ordering full-size pieces or mini rolls.

Most sod farms in Northeast Florida cut their sod in one of three formats: slabs (also called pieces or squares), large rolls, or mini rolls. The most common format for residential deliveries is the slab, which typically measures 16 inches by 24 inches. A standard pallet of sod slabs usually contains 165 to 171 pieces, depending on the farm's cutting specifications.

When you multiply the number of pieces by their individual size, you get the total coverage. For example, 165 pieces at 16" x 24" each equals approximately 440 square feet per pallet. Some farms cut slightly different dimensions or stack more pieces per pallet, which is why you'll see coverage ranging from 400 to 500 square feet.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** Always confirm the exact coverage with your sod supplier before ordering. At Jax Sod, we provide precise measurements for each grass type we carry, so you know exactly what you're getting.

## Coverage Differences by Grass Type

Not all grass types are cut and sold the same way. In Jacksonville, the coverage per pallet can vary based on which variety you choose for your lawn.

### St. Augustine Grass Pallets

St. Augustine is the most popular turfgrass in Jacksonville, and most farms cut it in standard slabs. A typical pallet of St. Augustine (whether it's Floratam, Palmetto, CitraBlue, or another variety) covers approximately 450 square feet. Some farms may cut it slightly larger or smaller, but 450 square feet is a reliable planning number for most St. Augustine varieties.

Because St. Augustine has a denser growth pattern and thicker root system, the pallets tend to be quite heavy—typically 2,000 to 2,500 pounds when freshly cut. This weight matters significantly when planning delivery and placement.

### Bermuda Grass Pallets

Bermuda grass, including popular varieties like TifTuf, Celebration, and Tifway 419, is often cut in larger pieces or rolls. A standard Bermuda pallet might cover 500 to 550 square feet because the grass is more resilient and can be cut thinner than St. Augustine.

Bermuda pallets typically weigh between 1,500 and 2,000 pounds, making them somewhat lighter than St. Augustine pallets of similar coverage. This can make a difference if you're having sod delivered to a location with access challenges.

### Zoysia Grass Pallets

Zoysia varieties like Empire, Zeon, and Palisades are premium grasses that typically come in standard pallet sizes covering 400 to 450 square feet. Because zoysia is often cut with a thicker soil layer for better transplant success, these pallets can be quite dense and heavy—sometimes reaching 2,500 to 3,000 pounds.

The extra weight is worth it, though. Zoysia establishes beautifully in Jacksonville's climate and offers excellent drought tolerance once rooted, making it increasingly popular in neighborhoods like Ponte Vedra, Nocatee, and Deerwood.

### Bahia Grass Pallets

Bahia grass, while less common for residential lawns, is sometimes used for large properties or areas with poor soil. Bahia pallets typically cover 400 to 450 square feet and weigh between 1,800 and 2,200 pounds. Because bahia is a lower-maintenance, more utilitarian grass, it's often cut with slightly less soil, resulting in lighter pallets than St. Augustine or zoysia.

## Mini Rolls vs. Large Rolls vs. Slabs

The format in which your sod is cut significantly affects both coverage calculations and installation ease. Let's break down the three main formats available in the Jacksonville market.

### Slabs (Pieces or Squares)

Slabs are the traditional format—rectangular pieces typically measuring 16" x 24" or similar dimensions. A pallet contains 165 to 171 pieces and covers 400 to 500 square feet depending on the exact dimensions. Slabs are easier to handle for DIY installations because each piece weighs only 10 to 15 pounds, and they're simple to cut and fit around landscape features.

For Jacksonville homeowners installing their own sod in areas like San Marco or Riverside, slabs are often the best choice. They're manageable, stack neatly, and allow precise placement.

### Mini Rolls

Mini rolls are becoming increasingly popular for residential projects. Each roll is typically 2 feet wide by 5 feet long (10 square feet per roll), and a pallet contains 40 to 50 rolls, covering 400 to 500 square feet total. Mini rolls install faster than slabs because you're laying fewer pieces, but each roll weighs 40 to 50 pounds, making them harder to handle alone.

If you're working with a professional installer or have help, mini rolls can speed up your project significantly. They're especially efficient for larger, open areas without many obstacles.

### Large Rolls

Large rolls—often called "big rolls"—are typically used for commercial projects or very large residential properties. These rolls can be 4 feet wide by 60 feet long (240 square feet per roll) and require specialized equipment to move and install. A "pallet" of big rolls might actually be just one or two rolls on a large spool.

For most Jacksonville residential projects, large rolls aren't practical unless you're sodding a substantial area like a new construction development in Fruit Cove or a large acreage property in Middleburg. The equipment required and minimum order quantities make them cost-effective only at scale.

## Weight Per Pallet and Delivery Requirements

Understanding pallet weight is critical for planning your delivery and placement. A freshly cut pallet of sod contains not just grass, but also soil and moisture, making it surprisingly heavy.

Most pallets range from 1,500 to 3,000 pounds depending on grass type, soil moisture, and how much root zone soil is included. St. Augustine and zoysia pallets tend toward the heavier end, while Bermuda pallets are typically lighter.

This weight has several important implications for your Jacksonville sod delivery:

**Forklift Requirements:** A full pallet of sod cannot be unloaded by hand. You'll need either a forklift or a delivery truck with a mechanical offloading system. At Jax Sod, we provide forklift delivery as part of our service, placing pallets exactly where you need them on your property.

**Ground Conditions:** The delivery area must be relatively flat and solid. Soft sand, steep slopes, or muddy areas can make pallet placement difficult or impossible. This is especially relevant in Jacksonville's coastal areas like Atlantic Beach or Neptune Beach, where sandy soil predominates.

**Access Requirements:** Ensure there's clear access for the delivery vehicle and adequate space for the forklift to maneuver. Narrow side yards, gates, or overhead obstacles can complicate delivery. If access is limited, you may need pallets placed in the driveway or street, requiring you to move sod pieces to the installation area manually.

**Surface Protection:** A 2,000-pound pallet placed on your driveway can leave marks on asphalt, especially in Jacksonville's summer heat when pavement is soft. If possible, have pallets placed on concrete, pavers, or directly in the yard near the installation area.

## Calculating How Many Pallets You Need

The math for determining your pallet needs is straightforward, but accuracy matters. Ordering too little means delays while you wait for more sod, potentially causing seams and uneven establishment. Ordering too much wastes money and creates disposal hassles.

Here's how to calculate your sod needs for a Jacksonville lawn:

1. **Measure your lawn area:** Calculate the square footage of the area to be sodded. For rectangular areas, multiply length by width. For irregular shapes, break them into rectangles or triangles and add the areas together. Don't forget to subtract areas occupied by the house, driveway, walkways, patios, or landscape beds.

2. **Add 5-10% for waste:** Cutting sod to fit around curves, trees, sprinkler heads, and other obstacles creates waste. For simple rectangular areas, add 5%. For complex layouts with many obstacles (common in established neighborhoods like Avondale or Mandarin), add 10%.

3. **Divide by pallet coverage:** Divide your adjusted square footage by the coverage per pallet for your chosen grass type. Always round up to the nearest whole pallet.

**Example calculation for a Jacksonville yard:**
- Lawn area: 2,800 square feet
- Waste factor: 8% (moderately complex)
- Adjusted area: 2,800 × 1.08 = 3,024 square feet
- Grass choice: St. Augustine (450 sq ft per pallet)
- Pallets needed: 3,024 ÷ 450 = 6.72, rounds to 7 pallets

### Common Yard Sizes and Pallet Requirements

Here's a quick reference for typical Jacksonville residential properties:

| Lawn Size | St. Augustine (450 sq ft/pallet) | Bermuda (500 sq ft/pallet) | Zoysia (425 sq ft/pallet) |
|-----------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1,000 sq ft | 2-3 pallets | 2-3 pallets | 3 pallets |
| 2,000 sq ft | 5 pallets | 4-5 pallets | 5 pallets |
| 3,000 sq ft | 7 pallets | 6-7 pallets | 7-8 pallets |
| 4,000 sq ft | 9-10 pallets | 8-9 pallets | 10 pallets |
| 5,000 sq ft | 11-12 pallets | 10-11 pallets | 12-13 pallets |

These numbers assume a 5-10% waste factor already included. Your actual needs may vary based on your yard's complexity and the specific grass variety you choose.

## Sod Pricing by Pallet in Jacksonville

Sod pricing in Northeast Florida varies based on grass type, market conditions, and season. As of 2026, here are typical price ranges you can expect when ordering from quality suppliers in the Jacksonville area:

**St. Augustine varieties:** $130-$185 per pallet, depending on the specific variety. Floratam tends toward the lower end, while premium varieties like CitraBlue or Sapphire are higher.

**Bermuda varieties:** $140-$200 per pallet. TifTuf and Celebration command premium prices due to their superior drought tolerance and wear resistance.

**Zoysia varieties:** $160-$240 per pallet. Zoysia is the most expensive common turfgrass due to slower production and higher quality characteristics.

**Bahia grass:** $110-$140 per pallet, making it the most budget-friendly option for large areas.

These prices typically include delivery within a reasonable radius of Green Cove Springs and the Jacksonville metro area. Installation is separate and typically ranges from $0.30 to $0.60 per square foot depending on site preparation requirements.

Keep in mind that sod pricing can fluctuate based on season (higher in peak spring and fall installation periods), weather conditions affecting farm production, and fuel costs affecting delivery. At Jax Sod, we provide accurate quotes based on current market conditions and your specific project requirements.

## Shelf Life and Storage of Cut Sod

One of the most critical factors in successful sod establishment is installation timing. Cut sod is a living plant that has been severed from its root environment. It's under extreme stress and has a limited shelf life before it deteriorates beyond recovery.

In Jacksonville's climate—especially during our hot, humid summers—cut sod has a shelf life of only 24 to 48 hours maximum. The clock starts ticking the moment the sod is cut at the farm. Here's what happens if sod sits too long:

**0-12 hours:** Sod is in excellent condition. This is the ideal installation window. The grass is still fully viable, and establishment will be quick.

**12-24 hours:** Sod is still good but beginning to stress. The interior of the pallet is warming, and the grass may show slight yellowing. Installation within this window is fine, but you'll want to unstack pallets and spread them out if you can't install immediately.

**24-36 hours:** Sod is significantly stressed. Yellowing is obvious, especially in the center of the pallet where heat buildup is greatest. The grass can still survive if installed properly and watered aggressively, but establishment will be slower, and some yellowing may persist for weeks.

**36-48 hours:** Sod is near death. The grass has turned yellow or even brown, and a sour smell indicates decomposition. At this stage, installation is risky—the sod may not recover, and you could end up replacing it anyway.

**Beyond 48 hours:** In Jacksonville's heat, sod left on pallets for more than two days is likely dead or dying. Don't install sod in this condition—it's throwing good money after bad.

This aggressive timeline is why proper planning is essential. Don't order sod until your site is fully prepared and you're ready to install immediately upon delivery.

## Storage Tips If Installation Is Delayed

Sometimes despite best planning, installation gets delayed—weather turns bad, equipment fails, or personal emergencies arise. If you can't install your Jacksonville sod immediately, here are critical steps to extend its viability:

**Unstack the pallets immediately:** Heat buildup in the center of a stacked pallet is the primary killer of stored sod. Unstack the pallet and spread pieces in a single layer in a shaded area. This allows air circulation and prevents heat accumulation.

**Water lightly:** Mist the grass lightly to keep it from drying out, but don't saturate it. Too much water combined with stacked sod creates anaerobic conditions that cause rapid decomposition. Think "damp" not "wet."

**Keep it shaded:** Direct Jacksonville sun will quickly desiccate and kill exposed sod. Store pieces in full shade—under trees, beside your house, or covered with a breathable shade cloth. Don't use plastic tarps, which trap heat and moisture.

**Maximize air circulation:** Space pieces with slight gaps between them and elevate them off the ground if possible. Good airflow prevents the buildup of heat and ethylene gas (produced by stressed grass) that accelerates deterioration.

**Don't store on concrete or asphalt:** These surfaces radiate heat in Jacksonville's climate. Store sod on bare ground or grass if possible.

Even with perfect storage practices, you're only buying an extra 12 to 24 hours at most. Sod is meant to be installed, not stored. If a significant delay occurs, contact your supplier about returning the sod or scheduling a replacement delivery.
