# World Golf Village Lawn Care: Expert Tips for St. Johns County Yards

Living near the World Golf Hall of Fame comes with certain expectations. The neighborhoods around here—from Legacy Trail to St. Johns Golf & Country Club—maintain high standards for curb appeal. Your lawn is part of that picture, and keeping it healthy in our Zone 9a/9b climate takes some knowledge.

I've been maintaining lawns in World Golf Village for years, and I can tell you that our sandy soil and humid summers create specific challenges. But once you understand what works in this area, you can keep your yard looking sharp year-round.

## Understanding World Golf Village's Growing Conditions

The soil around World Golf Village is typical Northeast Florida: sandy, well-draining, and low in organic matter. While the drainage helps prevent standing water during our summer thunderstorms, it also means nutrients wash through quickly. Your lawn needs consistent feeding and watering to stay thick and green.

We're in Zone 9a, which gives us mild winters and long, hot summers. That's perfect for warm-season grasses, but you need to choose the right variety and maintain it properly. The humidity can encourage fungal issues if you're not careful about irrigation timing.

## Best Grass Types for World Golf Village Yards

Most homes around here have either St. Augustine, Bahia, or Zoysia. Each has its place depending on your specific needs.

**St. Augustine** dominates the residential lawns in World Golf Village, and for good reason. It handles our shade from live oaks well and creates that lush, carpet-like appearance most homeowners want. Floratam is the most common variety, though Palmetto and Captiva work better if you have more shade near tree lines.

St. Augustine needs consistent water—about 1 to 1.5 inches per week during growing season. The sandy soil means you'll need to water more frequently than clay-based areas, but for shorter durations to avoid runoff into the retention ponds.

**Bahia** grass is tougher and more drought-tolerant. You'll see it more on larger lots and in areas closer to the natural preserves. It doesn't look as manicured as St. Augustine, but it requires less maintenance and handles foot traffic better. Argentine Bahia is the preferred variety around here.

**Zoysia** is gaining popularity in the newer sections near World Commerce Parkway. Empire and Zeon varieties create a dense, fine-textured lawn that feels great underfoot. Zoysia is more cold-tolerant than St. Augustine and uses less water once established. The tradeoff is slower establishment and higher initial cost.

## Seasonal Lawn Care Calendar

### Spring (March-May)

Spring is go-time for lawn care in World Golf Village. As temperatures climb into the 70s and 80s, your grass breaks dormancy and starts aggressive growth.

Apply your first fertilizer application in late March or early April when you see consistent green-up. Use a slow-release formula with a 3-1-2 or 4-1-2 ratio (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium). Our sandy soil needs that regular nitrogen feeding.

Check your irrigation system before the dry season hits. Walk your zones and look for broken heads, poor coverage, or areas that stay too wet. The retention ponds throughout the neighborhood are designed to handle runoff, but overwatering wastes money and creates disease problems.

Pre-emergent herbicide should go down in February or March before soil temperatures hit 65-70°F. This prevents summer weeds like crabgrass from germinating. If you miss this window, you'll spend the summer fighting weeds instead of enjoying your yard.

### Summer (June-August)

Summer brings heat, humidity, and afternoon thunderstorms. This is when your lawn either thrives or struggles, depending on your maintenance routine.

Mow high and frequently. St. Augustine should be cut at 3.5 to 4 inches, Bahia at 3 to 4 inches, and Zoysia at 2 to 2.5 inches. Higher cutting height helps shade the soil, reduces water needs, and creates deeper roots. During peak growth in June and July, you might need to mow twice a week.

Water early in the morning—between 4 AM and 8 AM is ideal. This gives grass blades time to dry before evening, which reduces fungal disease risk. Our afternoon storms help, but they're unpredictable. Don't rely on rainfall alone to keep your lawn hydrated.

Watch for chinch bugs, especially in St. Augustine. These small insects suck sap from grass blades and create irregular yellow patches that quickly turn brown. The sunny areas near your driveway or along the street heat up first, which is where chinch bugs typically start. Catch them early before they spread.

### Fall (September-November)

Fall is the second-best time for lawn improvement in our area. Temperatures moderate, but grass is still actively growing.

Apply your final fertilizer application in September. This strengthens roots before winter and helps your lawn green up faster next spring. Use a balanced formula or one slightly higher in potassium to improve stress tolerance.

Overseed thin areas or consider sodding bare patches. The cooler temperatures and reliable rainfall make fall ideal for establishment. New sod needs consistent moisture for the first two weeks, and fall weather helps with that.

Reduce irrigation as temperatures drop and rainfall increases. St. Johns County enters the dry season in late fall, but October and November usually provide decent natural moisture. Adjust your controller settings monthly based on actual weather conditions.

### Winter (December-February)

Winters are mild around World Golf Village, but your lawn still slows down considerably. St. Augustine and Zoysia go dormant and turn tan or brown when we get hard freezes. Bahia holds color better.

Mow less frequently or not at all. Some winters, St. Augustine stays semi-active and needs occasional cutting. Other years, it goes fully dormant. Let the weather guide you.

This is the time for equipment maintenance. Sharpen mower blades, service your irrigation system, and plan any major landscape projects. Winter is also good for tree trimming, which improves sunlight penetration for spring growth.

## Irrigation Management

World Golf Village has strict watering restrictions through the St. Johns River Water Management District. Odd-numbered addresses water on Wednesday and Saturday. Even-numbered addresses water on Thursday and Sunday. Everyone can water on any day between November 1 and March 15.

Set your irrigation for early morning—ideally between 4 AM and 6 AM. Each zone should run long enough to put down about 0.75 inches of water per session. That usually means 45-60 minutes for standard pop-up spray heads on sandy soil.

Check your system monthly. The water pressure around here is good, but sprinkler heads still get knocked off-line by landscapers or clogged with debris. Walk your property while the system runs and look for dry spots, misting heads, or geysers from broken lines.

Rain sensors are required by law, but make sure yours actually works. Many get painted over during house painting or fail after a few years. A functional rain sensor saves water and prevents overwatering during our summer monsoon season.

## Fertilization Strategy

Sandy soil is hungry soil. Nutrients leach through quickly, especially nitrogen. Your lawn needs regular feeding to maintain density and color.

Plan for 4-6 applications per year for St. Augustine, 2-4 for Bahia, and 4-5 for Zoysia. Use slow-release nitrogen sources that feed over 6-8 weeks rather than quick-release types that flush through in two weeks.

Apply 0.5 to 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per application. That means if you have a 5,000 square foot lawn and use a 16-0-8 fertilizer, you'd apply about 15 pounds of product per application.

Don't fertilize when rain is forecasted within 24 hours. The nutrients wash into our storm drains and eventually reach the Tolomato River. Use a spreader and keep fertilizer off driveways and sidewalks. Sweep any stray granules back onto the lawn.

Micronutrients matter too. Iron keeps your lawn dark green without excess growth. Manganese prevents yellowing in high-pH soils. Many quality fertilizers include these as part of their formulation.

## Common Lawn Problems

**Brown Patch** shows up during humid weather, especially in spring and fall. You'll see circular patches of brown grass with a darker ring around the edge. Improve air circulation by pruning low tree branches, reduce nitrogen during outbreak periods, and avoid evening watering.

**Take-All Root Rot** is becoming more common in St. Augustine lawns around Northeast Florida. It creates irregular yellow and brown patches that don't respond to fertilizer or water. There's no cure, but maintaining proper pH (6.0-6.5) and avoiding over-fertilization helps prevent it.

**Mole Crickets** tunnel through the soil and eat grass roots. You'll see raised tunnels and loosened soil, especially near the golf courses and natural areas. They're active in spring when they do most damage. Treat in June when young nymphs are vulnerable.

**Grubs** are the larvae of May and June beetles. They feed on grass roots and create irregular dead patches that peel back like carpet. Birds pecking at your lawn often indicate grub activity. Apply treatment in late summer when eggs hatch.

## Working with HOA Standards

The various HOAs around World Golf Village maintain high standards for lawn appearance. Most require that grass be kept below a certain height, dead patches be repaired promptly, and major weed infestations be controlled.

Stay on top of basic maintenance to avoid violation notices. That means regular mowing during growing season, prompt repair of irrigation issues, and addressing bare spots before they expand.

If you're planning significant changes—like installing a new landscape bed or removing trees—check your HOA guidelines first. Most have architectural review processes that require approval before work begins.

## Getting Professional Help

Some homeowners handle everything themselves. Others prefer professional maintenance, especially during the demanding summer months. There's no right answer—it depends on your time, interest, and physical ability.

If you're hiring a lawn service, look for companies that understand the specific conditions around World Golf Village. Ask about their fertilization program, how they handle pest issues, and what their mowing schedule looks like during different seasons.

Quality lawn care in our area means working with the climate, not fighting it. The sandy soil, humid summers, and mild winters create opportunities for beautiful lawns when you use appropriate grass types and proper maintenance techniques.

Your lawn is an investment in your property value and your neighborhood's appearance. Understanding what works in World Golf Village helps you maintain that investment efficiently and effectively.
