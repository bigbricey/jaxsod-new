# Best Time to Water Your Lawn in Jacksonville

Watering your Jacksonville lawn seems simple: turn on the sprinklers and let them run. But timing, duration, and frequency make the difference between a healthy, drought-resistant lawn and one that struggles with disease, shallow roots, and high water bills. After 37 years maintaining lawns across Northeast Florida, we've seen firsthand how proper watering practices transform lawn health and how poor watering undermines even the best grass varieties.

The reality is that most Jacksonville homeowners either water at the wrong time of day or apply too much or too little water. They run sprinklers when they remember, water for arbitrary durations, and don't adjust for seasonal changes or rainfall. This wastes water, costs money, and often harms the lawn more than helping it.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll learn exactly when to water your Jacksonville lawn for optimal health, how SJRWMD restrictions affect your schedule, how much water to apply, seasonal adjustments for our climate, and smart irrigation strategies that save money while maintaining a beautiful lawn.

## Early Morning Is the Best Time to Water

Let's start with the single most important principle: early morning watering is ideal for Jacksonville lawns. Specifically, the window between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM provides optimal conditions.

### Why Early Morning Works

Several factors make early morning ideal. First, temperatures are coolest, typically 70-75°F even in summer. This minimizes evaporation loss, allowing more water to penetrate soil and reach roots. In contrast, midday watering during Jacksonville's 90-95°F summer heat loses significant water to evaporation before it benefits grass.

Second, wind speeds are lowest in early morning. Jacksonville's afternoon sea breezes (common in Beaches communities and along the St. Johns River) can blow sprinkler spray, reducing coverage uniformity. Early morning's calm conditions ensure water lands where you aim it.

Third, grass blades dry quickly in morning sun after watering. Wet grass blades are susceptible to fungal diseases, which thrive in Jacksonville's humidity. Morning watering allows grass to dry completely by mid-morning, minimizing disease risk. This is particularly important for St. Augustine grass (the most common lawn grass in Jacksonville), which is prone to brown patch and gray leaf spot fungus in wet conditions.

Fourth, water pressure is highest in early morning when neighborhood demand is low. If you're on city water through JEA, you'll notice stronger sprinkler performance at 5:00 AM versus 7:00 PM when everyone's running dishwashers, showers, and irrigation simultaneously.

### Practical Implementation

Set your irrigation controller or sprinkler timers to start between 4:00-5:00 AM. For typical Jacksonville residential systems with 4-6 zones, starting at 4:00 AM means all zones finish by 6:30-7:00 AM, well before you leave for work.

If you're manually watering with hoses or portable sprinklers, set them up before bed and put them on timers to start early morning. Inexpensive battery-operated hose timers (around $20-30 at local hardware stores) make this easy.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** For properties in neighborhoods like Riverside, San Marco, or Avondale with mature tree canopy, early morning watering is even more critical. Shaded lawns stay wet longer, so you need morning sun to dry grass before afternoon humidity creates ideal fungal conditions.

## Why Not to Water Midday or Evening

While early morning is ideal, midday and evening watering are common mistakes that cost Jacksonville homeowners money and lawn health.

### Midday Watering Problems

Watering between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM faces multiple challenges. Evaporation rates during Jacksonville's summer heat can exceed 50%, meaning more than half the water you apply never reaches grass roots. You're essentially watering the air, wasting both water and money.

Additionally, water droplets on grass blades act as tiny magnifying glasses, focusing sunlight and potentially burning grass. While this effect is minor, it's an unnecessary risk.

Most importantly, SJRWMD regulations prohibit irrigation between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM throughout Northeast Florida. Violating this can result in warnings and fines, particularly during drought conditions when enforcement increases.

The only exception is hand-watering specific plants with a hose, which is allowed anytime. But for lawn irrigation systems, midday watering is both wasteful and illegal.

### Evening Watering Problems

Evening watering (after 6:00 PM) seems logical: temperatures are cooler, you're home to supervise, and it fits your schedule. However, evening watering creates serious disease risks.

Grass that stays wet overnight faces 8-12 hours of prolonged moisture combined with Jacksonville's humid nights (often 85-95% relative humidity). This is the perfect environment for fungal diseases like brown patch, gray leaf spot, and dollar spot, all common in Northeast Florida lawns.

St. Augustine grass, which dominates Jacksonville lawns, is particularly susceptible. We've seen countless cases where switching from evening to morning watering eliminated recurring fungal problems without any chemical intervention.

Bermuda and Zoysia grasses are more disease-resistant than St. Augustine but still benefit from morning watering that allows foliage to dry completely. Bahia grass, the most disease-resistant option, tolerates evening watering better but still performs best with morning schedules.

### When Evening Watering Is Acceptable

There are situations where evening watering is the lesser of evils. During extreme heat waves (multiple consecutive days over 95°F), grass under severe drought stress benefits from evening watering to survive the night. In these emergency situations, preventing grass death outweighs disease risk.

For newly installed sod during Jacksonville's summer months, you may need midday or afternoon watering in addition to morning watering. During the first 2-3 weeks of establishment, keeping sod from drying out trumps all other concerns. Once established, transition to morning-only watering.

## St. Johns River Water Management District Restrictions

Jacksonville lawn watering operates under SJRWMD regulations, which are mandatory across Duval, Clay, St. Johns, and Nassau counties. Understanding these rules is essential to avoid violations and fines.

### Year-Round Watering Day Schedule

SJRWMD's permanent restrictions assign watering days based on your street address:

- **Odd-numbered addresses:** Wednesday and Saturday
- **Even-numbered addresses:** Thursday and Sunday
- **Non-addressed properties** (common areas, businesses, parks): Tuesday and Friday

This schedule applies year-round, including winter when grass needs minimal water. You may water on both of your assigned days, just one, or neither, depending on your lawn's needs and weather conditions.

For properties in neighborhoods like Nocatee, Bartram Park, or Town Center where HOA common areas and residential lawns coexist, remember that common areas have different watering days. This explains why you might see irrigation running on days when residents aren't allowed to water.

### Time-of-Day Restrictions

In addition to day restrictions, SJRWMD prohibits irrigation between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM every day. This restricts watering to early morning (midnight-10:00 AM) or evening (4:00 PM-midnight).

Given that morning is optimal for lawn health, most Jacksonville homeowners schedule irrigation between 4:00-8:00 AM on their designated days.

### Exemptions and Special Circumstances

Several exemptions to SJRWMD restrictions exist:

**New sod exemption:** Newly installed sod may be watered daily as needed for 30 days after installation, regardless of your address or day restrictions. However, you're still prohibited from watering 10:00 AM-4:00 PM. This exemption is critical during establishment when sod needs frequent watering.

**Hand watering exemption:** You may hand-water specific plants, trees, or targeted lawn areas with a hose anytime, any day. This exemption doesn't extend to automated sprinklers or unattended hoses.

**Micro-irrigation exemption:** Drip irrigation and micro-sprayers used in landscape beds and around trees and shrubs may operate any day but must still avoid 10:00 AM-4:00 PM.

**Reclaimed water systems:** Properties using reclaimed water (common in some St. Johns County developments) have slightly different schedules. Check with your utility provider for specific rules.

To register for new sod exemption or verify current restrictions, contact SJRWMD at sjrwmd.com or call 386-329-4500. The district is reasonable and helpful, not punitive, as long as you're making good-faith efforts to comply.

### Enforcement and Penalties

SJRWMD enforcement is typically complaint-driven rather than active patrol. However, during drought conditions or water shortages, enforcement increases. Initial violations typically result in warnings. Repeated violations can bring fines of $50-500, and extreme cases can result in meter installation (if you're on well water) or water service restrictions.

Most Jacksonville homeowners never face enforcement because reasonable compliance is straightforward: water on your designated days, before 10:00 AM or after 4:00 PM, and avoid egregious waste like broken sprinkler heads spraying sidewalks or driveways.

## How Much Water to Apply Per Session

Knowing when to water is only half the equation. You also need to know how much water to apply. Too little leads to shallow roots and drought stress; too much leads to waste, high water bills, and disease.

### The Three-Quarter-Inch Rule

Established lawns in Jacksonville need approximately 3/4 to 1 inch of water per week during the growing season, including rainfall. St. Augustine, Bermuda, and Zoysia grasses all fall in this range. Bahia grass needs slightly less, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch weekly.

When you water, apply the full weekly amount in one or two deep waterings rather than frequent shallow waterings. For example, if you're watering twice per week (typical for Jacksonville's twice-per-week watering restrictions), apply 3/8 to 1/2 inch each session.

Deep, infrequent watering encourages deep root growth. Grass roots follow water, so if you only wet the top 2 inches of soil with light daily watering, roots stay shallow. Shallow roots make grass vulnerable to heat stress and drought. Deep roots reaching 6-8 inches into the soil access moisture and nutrients unavailable to shallow-rooted grass.

This is particularly important in Jacksonville's sandy soil, which drains quickly. You want to encourage roots to penetrate deep where moisture lingers longer between irrigation cycles.

### The Tuna Can Test

How do you measure 3/4 inch of water? The classic method is the tuna can test, which is simple, free, and surprisingly accurate.

Place 4-6 empty tuna cans (or any straight-sided container about 1 inch tall) around your yard in different zones. Run your sprinklers for 15 minutes. Measure the depth of water collected in each can. If cans contain 1/4 inch of water after 15 minutes, your system applies 1 inch per hour, so run it for 45 minutes to apply 3/4 inch.

Perform this test for each irrigation zone, as coverage varies. Zones with rotary heads (larger, rotating sprinklers) typically apply water slower than zones with spray heads (smaller, fixed-pattern sprinklers). A rotary zone might need 60 minutes to apply 3/4 inch, while a spray head zone might need only 30 minutes.

Run the tuna can test when you first set up your irrigation system or timer, and repeat it annually since sprinkler performance changes as heads clog, wear out, or shift position.

### Adjusting for Rainfall

Jacksonville receives about 52 inches of rainfall annually, heavily concentrated June-September (our wet season). During summer, afternoon thunderstorms often deliver 1-2 inches of rain in a single event. This can eliminate your lawn's water needs for a week or more.

The most water-wise Jacksonville homeowners reduce or skip irrigation after significant rainfall. If you received 1 inch of rain on Tuesday, you don't need to water Wednesday or Thursday. Wait until the following weekend or longer if soil moisture remains adequate.

The challenge is measuring rainfall accurately and adjusting irrigation accordingly. Rain gauges (simple and cheap, $5-15) help track rainfall. Place one in an open area of your yard and check it weekly.

Even better, install a rain sensor on your irrigation system. Florida law requires rain sensors on all new irrigation systems installed since 1991, but many older systems lack them or have non-functional sensors.

## Rain Sensors: Florida's Requirement for Smart Watering

Rain sensors are small devices that detect rainfall and automatically skip irrigation cycles when adequate rain has fallen. They're mandatory in Florida and one of the most effective water-saving technologies available.

### How Rain Sensors Work

Rain sensors mount on a downspout, fence post, or side of your house where they're exposed to rainfall. When rain fills the sensor to a preset level (typically 1/4 or 1/2 inch), it sends a signal to your irrigation controller to skip scheduled watering.

As collected rainwater evaporates over 2-3 days, the sensor resets and allows irrigation to resume. This automatic process ensures you don't water immediately after rain but resumes watering after a few dry days.

Quality rain sensors cost $25-75 and are easy to install. Many Jacksonville irrigation companies include installation when servicing systems. For DIY installation, simple wired sensors connect to your controller's sensor terminals with two wires.

### Florida's Rain Sensor Law

Florida Statute 373.62 requires rain sensors on all automatic irrigation systems installed after May 1991. This law applies statewide, including all Jacksonville-area properties.

If your system pre-dates 1991 or your sensor is broken or missing, you're not grandfathered in. SJRWMD strongly recommends upgrading older systems with rain sensors, and some water utilities offer rebates for installation.

Beyond legal compliance, rain sensors save money. Studies by UF/IFAS show rain sensors reduce irrigation water use by 20-40% in Florida, translating to $10-30 monthly savings on typical Jacksonville water bills during summer.

### Checking and Maintaining Your Rain Sensor

Many rain sensors fail over time due to debris buildup, wasp nests, or mechanical wear, but homeowners don't notice because the system keeps running normally without the sensor active.

Test your rain sensor twice yearly (spring and fall):

1. Manually fill the sensor with water until it clicks (simulating rainfall)
2. Attempt to run an irrigation zone manually from your controller
3. If the zone doesn't run, your sensor is working correctly
4. If the zone runs despite the filled sensor, the sensor is broken or disconnected

Clean sensors annually by removing the cap and rinsing out debris, insect nests, and sediment. Replace sensors every 5-7 years as internal mechanisms wear out.

## Seasonal Watering Adjustments for Jacksonville

Jacksonville's climate requires different watering approaches throughout the year. Grass water needs change dramatically between seasons.

### Spring (March-May)

Spring is Jacksonville's most pleasant season with moderate temperatures (70s-80s), moderate rainfall, and rapid grass growth as warm-season grasses break dormancy.

**Watering frequency:** Begin with once weekly watering in March, increasing to twice weekly by May as temperatures rise. Watch for rainfall; spring thunderstorms occasionally eliminate irrigation needs for 1-2 weeks.

**Duration:** Apply 3/4 inch per week total. If watering twice weekly, apply 3/8 inch per session.

**Fertilization connection:** Spring is prime fertilization season (late March-April). After fertilizing, water thoroughly to move nutrients into the soil and prevent burn.

### Summer (June-September)

Summer is Jacksonville's wet season but also the hottest, with highest evapotranspiration rates. Grass needs maximum water despite frequent afternoon thunderstorms.

**Watering frequency:** Twice weekly on your designated SJRWMD days is standard. During extreme heat (multiple days over 95°F), watch for drought stress signs (blue-gray color, footprints remaining visible, curled blades) and water more if allowed.

**Duration:** Apply 1 inch per week total (1/2 inch per session twice weekly). Sandy soil drains quickly even in wet season, so don't assume summer rain eliminates irrigation needs entirely.

**Rainfall management:** Summer thunderstorms are intense but localized. You might receive 2 inches of rain at your Southside home while properties 5 miles away in Arlington receive none. Use a rain gauge and sensor to track actual rainfall at your property rather than assuming news reports of area rainfall apply to you.

**Heat stress response:** During mid-afternoon heat, grass may wilt temporarily even with adequate soil moisture. This is normal. Don't panic and overwater; the grass will perk up by evening.

### Fall (October-November)

Fall brings decreasing temperatures, less rainfall, and slowing grass growth. It's Jacksonville's second prime growing season with ideal conditions.

**Watering frequency:** Continue twice weekly through October, reducing to once weekly by mid-November as temperatures consistently drop into the 60s-70s.

**Duration:** Apply 3/4 inch per week. Watch for extended dry periods; fall often brings 2-3 week stretches with no rain, requiring consistent irrigation.

**Transition preparation:** Late fall is when you prepare irrigation systems for reduced winter demand. Check that all zones still function properly, clean or replace clogged heads, and adjust controllers for winter schedules.

### Winter (December-February)

Winter is Jacksonville's dry season with minimal rainfall, cool temperatures, and dormant or semi-dormant grass growth.

**Watering frequency:** Most established St. Augustine, Zoysia, and Bahia lawns need minimal to no irrigation December-February. Water only if grass shows drought stress after 3-4 weeks without rain. Bermuda grass is fully dormant and needs almost no water.

**Duration:** When you do water, apply 1/2 inch, less than other seasons since evapotranspiration is minimal in cool weather.

**Rainfall dependence:** Jacksonville's winter rainfall averages only 2-3 inches per month. Monitor grass condition; if you see drought stress, water regardless of season. Sandy soil dries out even in winter during extended dry spells.

**Frost considerations:** Rare winter freezes (a few nights per year in Jacksonville) can damage grass, particularly St. Augustine. Don't water right before predicted freezes, as wet grass is more susceptible to frost damage. Water 2-3 days before a freeze, giving grass time to dry while ensuring adequate soil moisture.

## Smart Irrigation Controllers: Jacksonville's Water-Saving Technology

Modern smart irrigation controllers represent the biggest advancement in residential lawn watering, saving 20-50% of water use compared to traditional timer-based systems.

### How Smart Controllers Work

Unlike traditional controllers that run on fixed schedules regardless of conditions, smart controllers adjust watering based on weather data. They use internet-connected weather stations, local rainfall measurements, and evapotranspiration calculations to determine exactly how much water your lawn needs each day.

On rainy days or after significant rain, smart controllers skip irrigation entirely. During hot, dry periods, they extend run times slightly. This automated adjustment eliminates the manual controller changes most homeowners never make.

Leading brands like Rachio, Hunter Hydrawise, and Rainbird WiFi controllers cost $150-400 and replace your existing controller. Installation is straightforward for anyone comfortable with basic wiring, or professional installation by Jacksonville irrigation companies runs $100-200.

### Benefits for Jacksonville Homeowners

Smart controllers offer specific advantages in Jacksonville's variable climate:

**Summer rain management:** Jacksonville's wet season features frequent thunderstorms, but coverage is spotty. Your property might receive 1 inch while neighbors receive none. Smart controllers using hyperlocal weather data adjust for your specific location.

**Water bill savings:** JEA's tiered water rates mean heavy users pay significantly more per gallon. Reducing irrigation by 30-40% can cut summer water bills by $20-40 monthly, meaning the controller pays for itself in 6-12 months.

**SJRWMD compliance:** Smart controllers honor watering day restrictions while optimizing schedules within allowed days. You maintain compliance while maximizing efficiency.

**Remote control:** Control your system from your phone anywhere. If you're traveling during a Jacksonville summer thunderstorm and want to skip irrigation, adjust it remotely. If you're away and a heat wave hits, you can add extra watering days if allowed by restrictions.

**Seasonal automation:** The system adjusts automatically for seasonal changes. You don't need to remember to reduce watering in November or increase it in May; the controller handles it.

### Rebates and Incentives

JEA and some St. Johns County utilities offer rebates for smart controller installation, typically $50-100. Check with your water provider for current programs. Even without rebates, water savings typically justify the cost within a year.

## Well Water Versus City Water Considerations

About 30-40% of Jacksonville-area homeowners use well water, particularly in Clay County, western Duval County, and St. Johns County. Watering with well versus city water affects strategy and costs.

### Well Water Advantages

Well water users avoid JEA's metered water charges, making irrigation essentially free except electricity to run the pump. This removes the financial incentive to minimize water use, though environmental responsibility and SJRWMD restrictions still apply.

Well water in much of the Jacksonville area comes from the Floridan Aquifer and often has higher mineral content (calcium, magnesium) than city water. While this can lead to hard water staining on driveways and sidewalks, the minerals slightly benefit grass growth.

### Well Water Challenges

Sulfur content is common in Northeast Florida well water, creating the characteristic "rotten egg" smell when irrigation runs. This is harmless to grass but unpleasant. Aeration systems can remove sulfur odor if it's bothersome.

Well pump capacity limits how many irrigation zones can run simultaneously. Most residential wells produce 5-15 gallons per minute, enough for 1-2 sprinkler zones at a time but not 4-5 zones simultaneously. This extends total irrigation time; a system that runs 60 minutes on city water might need 120 minutes on well water if zones must run sequentially.

Iron content in some well water can stain driveways, sidewalks, and home siding orange. If you have iron staining issues, consider iron filtration systems or adjust sprinkler heads to minimize overspray onto hardscaping.

### SJRWMD Rules for Well Water

SJRWMD restrictions apply equally to well water and city water. You cannot irrigate unlimited amounts just because you have a well. The day-of-week and time-of-day restrictions apply to all irrigation sources.

During drought emergencies, SJRWMD can require permits or meters for high-capacity wells. Residential wells typically don't face these restrictions, but commercial agricultural operations and large estates sometimes do.

## Signs You're Overwatering Versus Underwatering

Proper watering sits in the middle ground between too much and too little. Learn to recognize signs of each extreme so you can adjust your schedule.

### Overwatering Signs

Overwatered Jacksonville lawns display:

**Fungal growth:** Mushrooms popping up after rain, particularly in shady areas under trees in neighborhoods like Riverside or Mandarin, indicate excessive moisture. Brown patch and gray leaf spot fungus on grass blades confirm overwatering or poor timing (evening watering).

**Yellow grass:** Grass that's yellow-green rather than deep green suggests waterlogged roots that can't access oxygen or nutrients. This differs from the bright yellow of nitrogen deficiency, which appears patchy and irregular.

**Soft, squishy soil:** Stepping on the lawn feels spongy or mushy rather than firm. Your feet sink into saturated soil.

**Thatch buildup:** Thick thatch layers (the spongy brown layer between grass blades and soil) develop in overwatered lawns because decomposition slows in waterlogged conditions.

**Weed invasions:** Many weeds, particularly sedges and nutsedge, thrive in wet conditions. If you're battling persistent nutsedge in Jacksonville's already-wet summer, overwatering likely contributes.

### Underwatering Signs

Underwatered lawns show different symptoms:

**Blue-gray color:** Grass takes on a blue-gray or purple tint rather than healthy green. This is the first sign of drought stress, appearing before browning.

**Footprint test:** Walk across your lawn. If footprints remain visible for 10+ minutes because grass doesn't spring back, it's underwatered.

**Curling blades:** Grass blades fold or curl lengthwise to reduce surface area and conserve moisture.

**Brown patches:** Grass browns in high-traffic areas, full-sun sections, or spots with shallow soil first. These are "canary in the coal mine" areas that show stress before the rest of the lawn.

**Dry soil:** Probe soil with a screwdriver or long nail. If you can't easily push it 4-6 inches deep, soil is too dry.

Jacksonville's sandy soil means underwatering is more common than overwatering, particularly during hot, dry spring and fall periods. Stay vigilant for drought stress signs, especially if you're watering minimally to save money or conserve water.

## Adjusting Irrigation Controllers for Optimal Performance

Most Jacksonville irrigation controllers are set once and forgotten, running the same schedule year-round. This wastes enormous amounts of water.

### Basic Controller Programming

Modern irrigation controllers have three key settings:

**Watering days:** Program your SJRWMD-allowed days (Wednesday/Saturday for odd addresses, Thursday/Sunday for even addresses). Most controllers let you select specific days rather than intervals.

**Start times:** Set start times for early morning, typically 4:00-5:00 AM for the first zone. Controllers automatically advance through subsequent zones.

**Run times:** Set duration for each zone based on your tuna can test results. Zones aren't equal; rotary head zones might run 45-60 minutes while spray head zones run 20-30 minutes to deliver the same water depth.

Many homeowners make the mistake of setting all zones to the same duration. This results in some areas receiving too much water and others too little.

### Seasonal Adjustment Strategies

At a minimum, adjust your controller four times yearly:

**Late March:** Increase from winter schedule to spring schedule (once or twice weekly).

**Early June:** Increase to summer schedule (twice weekly at maximum duration).

**Early November:** Reduce to fall schedule (once or twice weekly).

**Early December:** Reduce to winter schedule (minimal watering, possibly turn system off).

Set phone calendar reminders for these adjustments. The 20 minutes spent reprogramming your controller saves hundreds of dollars and thousands of gallons annually.

### Zone-Specific Adjustments

Different areas of your property need different watering amounts:

**Full sun versus shade:** Sunny zones (south and west-facing areas, open lawns) need 20-30% more water than shaded zones under trees or along north sides of buildings. Reduce run times for shaded zones.

**Grass type variations:** If you have different grass types (common in Jacksonville properties with St. Augustine in back yards and Bahia or Bermuda in side yards), program zones differently. Bahia needs less water than St. Augustine; Bermuda needs more frequent but lighter watering than both.

**Soil variations:** Spots with deeper topsoil hold moisture longer and need less frequent watering. Areas with shallow soil over sand need more frequent watering.

Advanced controllers allow assigning different schedules to individual zones, making these adjustments easy.

## Conclusion

The best time to water your Jacksonville lawn is early morning, between 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM, on your SJRWMD-designated days. This timing minimizes evaporation, allows grass to dry before nightfall, and takes advantage of low demand and optimal conditions. Apply 3/4 to 1 inch of water per week through deep, infrequent watering sessions that encourage deep root growth in Jacksonville's sandy soil.

Adjust your watering schedule seasonally, reducing dramatically in winter and potentially increasing slightly during summer dry spells. Install and maintain a functioning rain sensor to comply with Florida law and reduce water waste by 20-40%. For maximum efficiency and savings, consider upgrading to a smart irrigation controller that automatically adjusts for weather and conditions.

Avoid the common mistakes of evening watering (which promotes disease), midday watering (which wastes water to evaporation and violates SJRWMD rules), and fixed year-round schedules that ignore seasonal changes. Learn to recognize signs of overwatering and underwatering so you can fine-tune your approach.

Proper watering is the single most important factor in Jacksonville lawn health after choosing the right grass variety. Get watering right, and your grass will develop deep roots, resist drought and disease, and thrive with minimal intervention. Get it wrong, and you'll battle constant problems no amount of fertilizer or treatment can fix.
