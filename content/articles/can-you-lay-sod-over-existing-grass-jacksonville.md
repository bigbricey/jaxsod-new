# Can You Lay Sod Over Existing Grass in Jacksonville?

The short answer is no—you should not lay sod over existing grass in Jacksonville or anywhere else. While this might seem like a time-saving shortcut that lets you skip the labor-intensive work of removing old turf, it's a mistake that will lead to poor results, wasted money, and likely require you to redo the entire project within months.

At Jax Sod, we've been installing lawns across Northeast Florida for over 37 years, and one of the most common questions we hear from homeowners in San Marco, Ponte Vedra, Mandarin, and throughout Duval County is whether they can simply lay new sod over their struggling existing lawn. We understand the appeal—removing old grass is hard work, especially in Jacksonville's sandy soil. But taking shortcuts during sod installation almost always backfires.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll explain exactly why laying sod over existing grass fails, what problems it creates, how to properly remove old turf, and why Jacksonville's unique soil conditions make proper preparation even more critical for long-term lawn success.

## Why You Cannot Lay Sod Over Existing Grass

When you lay new sod over existing grass, you're essentially creating a layered sandwich with living grass on top, dying grass in the middle, and soil on the bottom. This structure creates multiple serious problems that prevent the new sod from establishing properly.

### Root Contact Issues

The most fundamental problem is lack of root-to-soil contact. For sod to establish successfully, the roots on the underside of the new turf must make direct contact with prepared soil. Roots need to penetrate into the native soil quickly to access water and nutrients.

When you place sod over existing grass, the roots encounter a barrier of organic matter—old grass plants, thatch, and dead material. Even if the old lawn is thin or patchy, it creates a layer that prevents proper root penetration. The new sod's roots will attempt to grow downward but struggle to push through the organic barrier, resulting in shallow rooting that leaves the lawn vulnerable to stress, drought, and disease.

In Jacksonville's sandy soil, this problem is amplified. Our soil doesn't hold moisture well compared to clay or loam soils found elsewhere. New sod needs every advantage to establish deep roots quickly. A barrier between the sod and the soil delays establishment significantly, sometimes by weeks or even months—time during which the sod is stressed and vulnerable to Florida's intense summer heat.

### Air Pockets and Uneven Surfaces

Old grass creates an irregular surface full of bumps, depressions, and variations in height. When you lay new sod over this uneven terrain, air pockets form between the new sod and the ground beneath. These air pockets are deadly to new sod for several reasons.

First, air gaps prevent roots from reaching soil and moisture. Where air pockets exist, roots simply dangle in space rather than pushing into the soil. These areas of the sod don't root at all, creating dead spots that brown out quickly.

Second, air pockets insulate the sod roots from the soil's moisture. Even if you water religiously, water drains through the sandy Jacksonville soil quickly. Air gaps prevent capillary action that would normally draw moisture up to the root zone during dry periods between waterings.

Third, air pockets make the lawn surface spongy and uneven. Walking on poorly installed sod feels soft and unstable, and mowing becomes difficult because the mower wheels sink into low spots while scalping high areas. This is particularly problematic in neighborhoods like Deerwood and Town Center where homeowners' associations enforce strict lawn appearance standards.

### Disease and Pest Transfer

If you're replacing your lawn, there's usually a reason—disease, insect damage, wrong grass type for the conditions, or years of neglect have left it beyond recovery. Laying new sod over this compromised turf means every problem affecting the old lawn is now trapped beneath your new investment.

**Fungal diseases:** Brown patch, gray leaf spot, and dollar spot are common in Jacksonville's humid climate. These fungal pathogens live in the soil and old plant material. Trapping diseased grass under new sod creates a perfect environment for continued disease pressure. The decomposing grass stays moist and shaded, allowing fungi to thrive and infect your new sod from below.

**Insect pests:** Chinch bugs, sod webworms, and grubs often infest struggling lawns. These pests don't die just because you covered them with new grass. They'll continue feeding, now with two layers of turf to damage. Worse, it becomes difficult to diagnose pest problems because you can't see or treat the old grass layer where many pests hide.

**Weed seeds:** Old lawns often contain countless weed seeds in the thatch layer and upper soil. Covering them with sod doesn't eliminate them. As the old grass decomposes and light eventually penetrates, those weed seeds germinate, pushing up through the new sod and creating immediate weed pressure.

At Jax Sod, we've been called to fix numerous lawns where homeowners tried to lay sod over old turf and ended up with disease, pest, and weed problems that were far worse than if they'd started with a clean slate.

### Decomposition Problems

Grass is organic matter, and when you bury it by laying sod on top, it begins to decompose. This decomposition process creates several serious issues that compromise your new lawn.

As the buried grass breaks down, it consumes nitrogen from the soil—nitrogen that your new sod desperately needs to establish. This creates a nitrogen deficiency that stunts growth and causes the new sod to turn pale yellow-green instead of the deep green you're expecting. You'll end up applying extra fertilizer to compensate, increasing costs and potentially contributing to groundwater pollution.

Decomposition also produces gases, primarily carbon dioxide and in anaerobic conditions (common in Jacksonville's heavy summer rains), methane. These gases create additional air pockets and can be toxic to plant roots in high concentrations. The decomposing grass layer becomes a source of ongoing problems for months as it slowly breaks down.

The decomposition process is irregular, happening faster in some areas than others based on moisture, grass density, and soil conditions. This creates differential settling where parts of your new lawn sink as the organic matter below compresses, while other areas remain higher. The result is a wavy, uneven surface that looks unprofessional and is difficult to maintain.

In Jacksonville's climate, with our 52 inches of annual rainfall and hot, humid summers, decomposition happens faster than in cooler, drier climates. But "faster" still means months of problems, not days. You're looking at 6 to 12 months of a struggling, uneven, problematic lawn while the old grass fully breaks down.

## The Right Way to Prepare for Sod

Proper preparation is the foundation of a successful sod installation. While it requires more work upfront, doing it right means your new lawn establishes quickly, looks great, and lasts for decades. Here's how to properly prepare a Jacksonville yard for new sod.

### Remove the Old Grass Completely

The first essential step is complete removal of existing turf. There are three main methods, each with advantages depending on your situation.

**Sod cutter method:** The fastest and most effective approach is using a mechanical sod cutter—a gas-powered machine that slices horizontally beneath the grass, cutting through roots and removing the grass with a thin layer of root zone. For Jacksonville homeowners, sod cutters can be rented from equipment rental companies for about $90-$150 per day.

Sod cutters work quickly once you get the hang of operating them. An average homeowner can remove 2,000 to 3,000 square feet of old turf in a day. The machine cuts the old grass into rolls that can be hauled away or composted. In Jacksonville's sandy soil, sod cutters work particularly well because the loose soil makes cutting easier than in clay soils.

The main downside is physical effort—sod cutters are heavy machines that require strength to maneuver, and the cut turf is heavy to roll up and remove. If you're tackling a large area or prefer not to do heavy physical labor, professional removal is worth considering.

**Herbicide method:** For a no-till approach that doesn't require removing the physical grass, you can kill the old lawn with a non-selective herbicide like glyphosate (Roundup). This method works well if you have time—it takes 7 to 14 days for the grass to die fully, and you should wait another week for the herbicide to fully degrade before installing new sod.

The advantage is less physical labor and no need to rent equipment. The disadvantages are time (2-3 weeks minimum), the need to water regularly during the waiting period to prevent the dead grass from blowing away, and the fact that you're left with a layer of dead organic matter that should be raked up before sodding.

In Jacksonville, the herbicide method works best in fall or winter when temperatures are moderate. Attempting this in summer creates other problems—dead brown grass is a fire hazard, and it's difficult to keep the dead turf intact during our frequent afternoon thunderstorms.

**Smothering method:** The most time-consuming but also the most organic approach is smothering the old grass. Cover the existing lawn with heavy cardboard, multiple layers of newspaper, or landscape fabric, then top with 2 to 4 inches of soil or compost. After 4 to 8 weeks, the grass dies and begins decomposing. Remove the covering material and install sod on the amended soil.

This method is really only practical for very small areas or for homeowners with plenty of time and a preference for avoiding herbicides. For most Jacksonville residential lawns, the time investment isn't justified, and the delay pushes installation into less favorable seasons.

### Soil Preparation

Once old grass is removed, proper soil preparation is critical. Jacksonville's sandy soil requires specific attention to create an ideal growing medium for new sod.

**Test your soil:** Start with a soil test from the UF/IFAS Extension Office in Jacksonville. This $7-$10 test reveals your soil's pH, nutrient levels, and organic matter content. Jacksonville soil is typically acidic (pH 5.5-6.5) and low in organic matter. Your soil test results will guide amendments.

**Add organic matter:** Sandy soil drains quickly but doesn't hold nutrients or moisture well. Incorporating 2 to 3 inches of compost or composted manure into the top 4 to 6 inches of soil dramatically improves water retention and nutrient availability. This is especially important for water-hungry grass types like St. Augustine.

**Adjust pH if needed:** Most turfgrasses prefer soil pH between 6.0 and 7.0. If your test shows pH below 5.5 (common in Jacksonville), add lime per the soil test recommendations. If pH is above 7.5 (rare but possible in areas with shell-based fill), add sulfur to lower it.

**Level and grade properly:** Use a landscape rake to level the soil and establish proper drainage. Grade should slope away from foundations at a minimum rate of 2% (2 feet of drop per 100 feet of distance). Fill low spots and remove high spots to create a smooth, even surface.

**Roll and water:** Use a lawn roller (rentable or you can make one by filling a large drum with water) to firm the soil and reveal any remaining high or low spots. Water the prepared soil and let it settle for a day or two before sod installation. This reveals any additional settling or areas that need adjustment.

> **Jacksonville Pro Tip:** In coastal areas like Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Neptune Beach, test for salt content if your property is close to the ocean. High salinity can affect grass establishment and may require leaching with fresh water before sodding.

## Jacksonville's Sandy Soil Makes Preparation Even More Important

Jacksonville sits on ancient sand deposits, and most residential properties have predominantly sandy soil with minimal clay or loam. This soil type has specific characteristics that make proper preparation absolutely essential for sod success.

Sandy soil is highly porous, meaning water drains through it very quickly. While this prevents waterlogging and ensures good oxygen availability to roots, it also means the soil doesn't hold moisture well during dry periods. New sod installed on unprepared sandy soil can dry out within hours on a hot, sunny Jacksonville day, even with irrigation.

The second characteristic of sandy soil is low nutrient retention. Nutrients are water-soluble, and as water drains quickly through sand, it carries nutrients with it. This leaching effect means sandy soil requires more frequent fertilization than heavier soils. New sod needs nutrients immediately to support establishment, so starting with properly amended soil is critical.

Finally, sandy soil has poor structure. Individual sand grains don't bind together well, so the soil doesn't form aggregates that create a stable growing medium. Without organic matter to bind sand particles, the soil is prone to surface crusting, erosion during heavy rains (common June through September in Northeast Florida), and compaction from foot traffic.

These characteristics mean that shortcuts are more costly in Jacksonville than in areas with heavier soils. In clay or loam soil, you might get away with minimal preparation and still achieve acceptable results. In sandy Florida soil, cutting corners almost guarantees failure.

## The Cost of Doing It Right vs. Doing It Twice

Many homeowners considering the shortcut of laying sod over existing grass are motivated by budget concerns. Removing old grass, preparing soil, and installing new sod professionally costs $2,500 to $5,000 for an average Jacksonville yard (about 2,500 square feet). That's not a trivial investment, so the temptation to cut corners is understandable.

But consider what happens when you try to save money by skipping preparation:

Your new sod costs $0.35 to $0.85 per square foot for materials, plus delivery. For that 2,500-square-foot yard, you're looking at $875 to $2,125 in sod alone. You've invested this money plus the labor of installation, whether you did it yourself or hired help.

Now imagine within 2 to 6 months, the sod is failing—patchy, diseased, uneven, struggling to root. You're facing a decision: pour more money into trying to rescue it with extra fertilizer, fungicides, pest control, and constant watering, or admit defeat and start over.

If you start over, you now need to remove the failed sod layer and the old grass layer underneath, prepare soil properly, and purchase and install new sod again. You've now paid for sod twice, plus the much more difficult removal of two layers of turf instead of one. The total cost easily exceeds $6,000 to $8,000—more than double what proper preparation would have cost initially.

Beyond the financial cost, there's the frustration of dealing with a problematic lawn for months, the embarrassment if you live in a neighborhood with HOA standards, and the time invested in attempting to fix an installation that was flawed from the start.

At Jax Sod, we've seen this scenario play out dozens of times in neighborhoods across Nocatee, Fruit Cove, and Orange Park. Homeowners who tried to save $500 to $1,000 on preparation ended up spending thousands more to fix the problem. The upfront investment in proper preparation isn't an expense—it's insurance against failure.

## Rare Exceptions: When You Might Get Away With It

In the interest of complete honesty, there are very limited circumstances where laying sod over existing grass might not be a total disaster—but these exceptions are rare and still not recommended.

**Exception 1: Very thin, completely dead grass layer:** If your existing lawn is nothing more than a few sparse, fully dead grass plants with exposed soil between them, and you've recently killed everything with herbicide and raked up the dead material, the remaining traces of root system might not cause major problems. You're essentially laying sod on bare soil with occasional dead roots, which is less problematic than laying over a thick, living lawn.

However, even in this scenario, you'd be better off spending an hour with a rake to remove those last traces rather than risking it. The minimal time savings doesn't justify the risk.

**Exception 2: Temporary installation:** If you're installing sod for a short-term event—say, a wedding in your backyard in two weeks and you plan to redo the lawn properly after the event—you might lay sod over existing grass just to green it up temporarily. The sod will look fine for a few weeks before problems emerge. This isn't a real exception for permanent lawn installation, but it illustrates that sod can technically survive short-term over existing grass before it fails.

In 37 years of business in Northeast Florida, we at Jax Sod have never recommended laying sod over existing grass, even in these edge cases. The risk-to-reward ratio simply doesn't make sense for a permanent lawn installation that you expect to last years or decades.

## Common Shortcuts That Backfire

Beyond laying sod directly over old grass, there are several related shortcuts that Jacksonville homeowners sometimes attempt. All of them create problems.

**Tilling old grass into the soil:** Some homeowners think they can use a rototiller to chop up old grass and mix it into the soil, creating an organic amendment while removing it as a surface barrier. This doesn't work. Tilling living grass just creates thousands of grass pieces, each capable of regrowing. You end up with new sod plagued by old grass sprouting through it.

Tilling can work if the old grass has been thoroughly killed with herbicide weeks earlier and is fully dead. But at that point, you're better off just removing the dead grass and tilling in proper compost instead of decomposing turf.

**Scalping old grass very short:** Some think that if they mow the old grass down to bare dirt, leaving only stubble, they can lay sod over it successfully. While this reduces the thickness of the barrier somewhat, it doesn't solve any of the fundamental problems—root contact, air pockets, disease transfer, and decomposition issues all remain.

**Laying sod, then cutting holes to spray herbicide through:** We've actually seen homeowners try this—lay new sod, then cut holes in it every few feet to spray herbicide through to kill the old grass underneath. This is creative but ineffective. The herbicide kills both the old and new grass, creating dead patches. Even if you're careful, it's impossible to kill grass underneath without affecting grass above.

**Laying sod over patches only:** For lawns with patchy dead areas but mostly intact grass, some homeowners try to lay new sod pieces only over the dead spots, leaving existing grass in place around them. This creates a quilt effect with different grass heights, colors, and textures. The new sod over bare spots will settle lower than the existing grass around it, creating an uneven surface. If you need to replace patches, remove the existing sod in those areas first, prepare the soil, and install new pieces level with the surrounding grade.
